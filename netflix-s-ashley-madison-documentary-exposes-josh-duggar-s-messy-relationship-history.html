Many fans of The Duggar family and their ill-fated reality TV show, 19 Kids and Counting, discovered that Josh was cheating on his wife, Anna, who allegedly didn't visit him in prison on his birthday, through <a href=#><strong>Netflix</strong></a>'s new docu-series, <strong>Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal</strong>.</p><p>In this article, we will delve into <strong>the revelations from the documentary about the Ashley Madison website hack</strong> and how they expose the dirty truth about Josh Duggar's relationship history.

But that doesn't mean it doesn't come with baggage. The infamous dating website for people seeking affairs was <strong>hacked in 2015 and is now the subject of a new Netflix docu-series, Ashley Madison: Sex, Lies & Scandal</strong>. The documentary explores how the unknown hackers breached the inner workings of the website and <strong>leaked the private information of over 30 million users</strong>. Yes, over 30 million people were signed up to Ashley Madison looking to cheat on their suppose in secret. Among them was Josh Duggar, the most disgraced member of the religious Duggar Family, known for their reality TV show.</p><ul><li>The Ashley Madison hack was one of the largest internet hacks in history, according to Global News</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/anna-and-josh-duggar-on-tlc.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Josh Duggar was convicted in 2021 for a heinous crime</strong></a> that will keep him locked up until at least October 2032.

At the time, Josh had to put out a statement, not only addressing being unfaithful to his wife but also touching upon the heinous crime that landed him in prison:</p><p>"I have been the biggest hypocrite ever. While espousing faith and family values, I have secretly over the last several years been viewing p*rnography on the internet and this became a secret addiction and I became unfaithful to my wife.

Based on the little she has said publicly after Josh Duggar's trial, it is unlikely that she knew of Josh's criminal behavior between the ages of 13 - 16. We can't go into detail about his admitted crimes during this age range, but they also <strong>involve being unfaithful to Kaeleigh Holt</strong>.
