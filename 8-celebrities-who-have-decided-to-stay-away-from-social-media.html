Since social media thrusts celebrities even more into the spotlight, some stars have struggled to handle the constant eyes on them. While some celebrities have deliberately taken <a href=#>social media breaks</a>, others have decided to stay off social media platforms altogether. Here are a few actors who have decided against having a public social media presence.</p><h2 id=andrew-garfield><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Andrew Garfield</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Even though Andrew Garfield <a href=#>starred in The Social Network</a>, he is not at all pro-social media. On the New York Times'Sway podcast, Andrew admitted that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he deleted his Facebook account </a>after starring in the film. He further elaborated, "If I wanted to have the life of privacy and protection and freedom and wholeness, I knew that I wasn't going to be able to be exposed to all of the faceless, voiceless, nameless people on social media."</p><h2 id=mary-kate-and-ashley-olsen><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Mary-Kate And Ashley Olsen</span></h2><p>After <a href=#>being famous for their entire childhood</a>, the Olsen twins have largely taken a step back from being in the public eye. Though they have been busy <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">running their luxury clothing line, The Row,</a> they do not publicize their personal lives in any capacity - not even on social media. They seem to try to stay away from the internet as much as possible as they apparently do not buy things online either.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Celebrities Deleted Social Media Posts Amidst Controversy">These Celebrities Deleted Social Media Posts Amidst Controversy</a></span></p><h2 id=scarlett-johansson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Scarlett Johansson</span></h2><p>Black Widow's Scarlett Johansson does not have a public social media presence, but she is not completely against social media. In a 2011 interview with Interview magazine, she explained that social media platforms are <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"amazing tools to communicate information."</a> She continued, "But I'd rather that people had less access to my personal life. If I could keep it that way, I'd be a happy lady."</p><h2 id=keira-knightley><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Keira Knightley</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Keira Knightley has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">tried social media</a>, but she was not a big fan. On The Jonathan Ross Show, she said,"I did actually join Twitter for about 12 hours because I tried to be down with the kids and it just creeped me out." Although the account wasn't under her name, once fellow actress Chloë Grace Moretz followed her, it was game over. Keira explained, "all these people started following me [...] and I just got completely freaked out."</p><h2 id=winona-ryder><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Winona Ryder</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While it's likely that Winona Ryder has had plenty of acting wisdom to share with her young Stranger Things co-stars, they may have been able to teach her a thing or two about social media in return. Winona told Marie Claire, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"Millie teases me. I'm like the old grandma</a> [...] I'm like the confused older person." Winona also admitted, "I'm grateful that I got the start at the time I did [...] I do worry about the massive exposure at that age."</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="These Musicians Started Their Career On Social Media">These Musicians Started Their Career On Social Media</a></span></p><h2 id=kate-winslet><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Kate Winslet</span></h2><p>After being in the business for the past four decades, Kate Winslet certainly doesn't need social media to stay relevant. Still, beyond her own personal choice to stay off of social media, she is also critical of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how social media can negatively impact young women and girls</a>. She told Harper's Bazaar, "We need to be aware of how damaging to children's self-esteem and the natural process of growing up certain aspects of this 'sharing' are."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-stone><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Emma Stone</span></h2><p>Though <a href=#>Emma Stone's fans would love to see her on social media</a>, it is unlikely they ever will. In an Elle interview with Jennifer Lawrence, she explained, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I think it wouldn't be a positive thing for me."</a> In another interview with Elle, Emma expressed that she feels that social media can be deceptive. She said, "When you see people like, 'This is the best life ever! I couldn't be happier,' you're like 'Shut up, that is not true.'"</p><h2 id=jennifer-lawrence><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Jennifer Lawrence</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Though Jennifer Lawrence is often very open during interviews, she has decided to keep her <a href=#>relatability</a> off of social media. She made a public Twitter account in 2020 to support the movement against racial injustice, but she does not have any other public social media accounts. She told InStyle that she fears the potential "backlash" that can come from posting publicly on social media. She said, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">"I'm a voyeur: I watch, I don't speak."</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZpuVobKjvsitoJ6rXay1sHnHmq2eZZSasKqwxJ1kraddqMGixYyarpqxXZu%2FsLmMrKacoZGheq6xw6KYaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./darci-lynne-farmer-net-worth-how-much-is-darci-lynne-farmer-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Darci Lynne Farmer Net Worth How Much is Darci Lynne Farmer Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./zella-leggings-with-pockets-are-up-to-25-off-right-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Zella Leggings With Pockets Are Up to 25% Off Right Now</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
