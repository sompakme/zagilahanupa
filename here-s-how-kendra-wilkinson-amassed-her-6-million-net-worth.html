First, she started out in Hugh Hefner's spotlight as one of his girlfriends. She even appeared on a reality series between 2004 and 2009 as one of many blonde bombshells who hung out at the Playboy Mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But then, after meeting her future husband (Hank Baskett), Kendra left Hugh in the dust.&nbsp;That was in 2009, of course, and these days, Kendra and Hank have since welcomed two children, had a very public breakup, and finalized their divorce noted <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a>.</p><p>But what fans really want to know about Kendra Wilkinson is how she amassed her $6M net worth.</p><p>Did Hugh Hefner leave Kendra a ton of cash when he passed away? Did her divorce from Hank result in a big payout? Or is the Playboy model turned reality TV star making her own cash?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Here's Who Inherited Most Of Hugh Hefner's Estate And Where They Are Now</a></span></p><p>Unfortunately for Kendra, she wasn't in Hugh Hefner's will when the Playboy magnate passed away in 2017. Still, that didn't mean she was on the outs with Hefner; when she and Hank wed in 2009, the event took place at the Playboy Mansion.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Of course, fans speculate that perhaps there was some quiet cash set aside for all Hugh's former GFs. With <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">all the strange facts surrounding the Mansion</a>, it wouldn't surprise anyone that there was a plan in place to provide for all the ladies.</p><p>Upon the couple's divorce in 2018, the pair split their property and agreed to share custody of their kids, Hank IV and Alijah. No word on the specific amounts of that property, though.</p><p>And as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> confirms, Kendra's worth about $6 million today, due to a combination of reality show appearances, brand endorsements, and questionable film sales.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yep,&nbsp;Celebrity Net Worth explained that in 2010, an awkward tape of Kendra and a former boyfriend surfaced. While Kendra initially fought the release of the tape, she eventually made a deal that netted her $680K for permission to publicize the footage.</p><p>But what about the rest of her wealth?</p><p>Kendra's other income-producing ventures are far tamer than that uncomfortable video tape. She's starred on two of her own reality shows, 'Kendra' and 'Kendra on Top.' But the leading lady also appeared on other shows like 'Celebrity Wife Swap' and even 'Dancing with the Stars.' She may not be <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the highest net worth champions</a>, but fans did love Kendra's appearance on 'DWTS.'</p><p>Further, Kendra has also ventured into the world of celebrity brand endorsements. She's partnered with brands like Teami, Shoedazzle, and even Claire's (yes, the store is still around!).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>So, what's up next for Kendra in terms of career moves? The single lady recently passed her California real estate exam. No doubt, she'll soon be moving high-priced properties for other celebs and earning commissions to match.</p><p>And who knows, maybe next year, her net worth will be a few million higher.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">I Do, I Do, I Don't: 10 Celebs With The Most Divorces In Hollywood</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaUp65uw8iloqKmo6S7brrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-why-mel-b-lost-primary-custody-of-daughter-madison-brown-belafonte-prior-to-her-bitter-battle.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Mel B Lost Primary Custody Of Daughter Madison Brown Belafonte Prior To Her Bitter Battle</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./emily-deschanel-news-us-weekly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Emily Deschanel News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
