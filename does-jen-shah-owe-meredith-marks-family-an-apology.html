Despite fans calling for Jen Shah to be fired following the news of her arrest, it's clear she's got a lot on her plate, however, starting drama with Meredith Marks and her family seems to be more of a priority than handling her legal troubles.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's known that <a href=#>Shah was arrested earlier this year</a> for allegedly leading a telemarketing scheme frauding thousands of people out of millions and millions of dollars, big yikes, however, that still doesn't seem to be enough to keep her off Twitter. Shah has been parading online liking tweets that have spoken ill of Meredith's son, Brooks Marks.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything We Know About 'RHOSLC' Newbie, Jennie Nguyen</a></span></p><p>Well, it seems as if their feud is only thickening following claims that Meredith may have <a href=#>tipped off Jen's location to the FBI,</a> however, their beef began far before Jen was taken away in handcuffs. So, did Jen go too far when it came to her attacks on Brooks? And does she owe Meredith and her family an apology? Yes, and yes.</p><h2 id=jen-shah-goes-after-meredith-39-s-son>Jen Shah Goes After Meredith's Son</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Jen Shah and Meredith Marks haven't always seen eye-to-eye, which ultimately led Jen to behave poorly online, no shocker there, right? Shah went ahead and began liking a slew of tweets that spoke ill of Meredith's son, Brooks Marks. Brooks, who has made a number of appearances on the show, has also had beef with Jen following a visit to their home where Jen allegedly flashed Meredith's kids.</p><p>This is where the feud first began, considering the duo were friendly up until that point. Well, during tonight's episode, Meredith is no longer disengaging and finally giving Jen a piece of her mind. After Jen went on an anti-Brooks parade online, liking and favoriting a number of horrible tweets, mainly about Brooks' sexuality, Meredith is now demanding an apology from Jen, however, is Shah even capable of that?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn't seem as if Meredith is giving up anytime soon, either, and we don't blame her! Marks claimed that J<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">en also liked a few "homophobic" tweets</a> regarding Brooks, despite the 22-year-old having yet to speak on his sexuality, which Jen knows! "I’m with you Meredith. I will defend my kids until I’m dead in the ground. Jen’s ridiculous for coming after Brooks," one fan wrote on Twitter.</p><p>Despite Meredith making total sense when it comes to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">defending her family</a>, it seems as if Jen is the only one oblivious to her awful actions, and no, we're not talking about her defrauding the elderly, we're still talking about her attacking Meredith's son, there's a lot, we know!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's Why Fans Want Jen Shah Fired From 'RHOSLC'</a></span></p><h2 id=heather-also-thinks-jen-should-apologize>Heather Also Thinks Jen Should Apologize</h2><p>Heather also gives Jen a piece of her mind during tonight's episode, making it clear that Shah was certainly in the hot seat, however, that ought to be great practice for when she's in the real hot seat, court, jury, judge, and all! Well, when it comes to Meredith and Jen's ongoing feud, it seems as if Heather is siding with Meredith on this one.</p><p>During her time on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen last week, Andy asked Heather if she'd be friends with Jen if Shah spoke ill of Heather's girls or liked tweets attacking them online. Heather was quick to say she would not be friends with Jen, and that she believes Shah owes Meredith and her family a massive apology.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although it seems as if Jen is trying to redeem herself, considering she got slaughtered (not actually) at the season one reunion, however, fans and her fellow co-stars aren't buying her act one bit! While this might seem like the height of Jen's issues, things are only going to get worse from here as her arrest is only weeks away.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>'RHOSLC': Heather Gay Struggles With Her Family Dynamic Since Leaving The Church</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGipoaejobBuw8eaq2aqlZa5rcWMoZipqJWjsqV5wZ6rsJ2Vo3qusdGem6KsmGK6or7KrGSappRit6a6jKyfmqBf</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./george-kennedy-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>George Kennedy Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./chris-melendez-wrestlezone.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>chris melendez - Wrestlezone</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
