As a member of a winning syndicate, Alex won £6.5 million in the UK's National Lottery in 2009. Newspapers reported that she spent the first few pounds of her new multi-million pound fortune at the Home Bargains shop which boasts "top brands at bottom prices".</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She subsequently quit her Liverpool-based IT job. And then she quit her weekend job at a bakery where she worked in order to save for a car. Well, you would, wouldn't you?</p><h2 id=kira-plastinina-18>Kira Plastinina, 18</h2><p>Born on 1 June 1992, in Russia, the self-styled "Princess of Global Fashion" Kira Plastinina has her own fashion chain - courtesy of daddy. Her father is Sergei Plastinin, the multimillionaire juice-and-dairy king of Eastern Europe. He helped her open her first Style Studio in 2007 at the age of just 15. Kira now has 63 Studios in Russia, 11 in the Ukraine and five in Kazakhstan.</p><p>Her ventures in the US proved less successful, despite her father investing $80 million (£54.6 million) setting up 12 stores there, but, undeterred, Kira continues on her quest to build her fashion empire, opening her second Style Studio in the Philippines only last month.</p><h2 id=mark-indelicato-15>Mark Indelicato, 15</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Ugly Betty star Mark Indelicato, who played Justin Suarez in the hit TV show, earned an annual $460,000 salary (£313,000). Indelicato, who is of Italian and Puerto Rican descent, began acting at the age of eight at Philadelphia's Walnut Street Theatre, before making it big in Ugly Betty.</p><p>The programme ran from 2006 until falling ratings prompted its cancellation in April 2010. Reports that he was given a rather modest $50 a week to spend on computer games and clothes - as well as some Kiehl's and Clarins skin-care products to avoid breakouts - suggest that much of his fortune probably remains intact.</p><h2 id=dakota-fanning-16>Dakota Fanning, 16</h2><p>She may be only 16, but Dakota Fanning has appeared in more films than most actresses could hope to in their whole career. She began her acting career at the age of five when she was picked for a Tide detergent television commercial.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, her performances have included playing alongside Tom Cruise in War of the Worlds, I Am Sam with Sean Penn and Charlotte's Web with Julia Roberts. At the age of just 13, she was ranked number three on Forbes rich list, earning $4 million (£2.7 million) a year.</p><h2 id=the-sprouse-twins-17>The Sprouse Twins, 17</h2><p>Twin brothers Cole Sprouse and Dylan Sprouse, born on 4 August 1992 are tipped to be the most successful twins since Mary-Kate and Ashley Olson. Named after the poet Dylan Thomas and musician Nat King Cole, the two boys, reportedly now both multi-millionaires, first appeared on screen at the tender age of just six months, in an advertisement for toilet paper.</p><p>They featured in their first major film Big Daddy, at the age of five, sharing the role of Julian, a boy adopted by Adam Sandler's character. However their big break came after being cast as leads in the Disney series, the Suite Life of Zac and Cody, which was a huge ratings success. Immensely popular among teen and pre-teen audiences, they even launched their own brand of clothing, magazines and comic books.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=abigail-breslin-14>Abigail Breslin, 14</h2><p>Breslin's acting career began when she was aged just three, with a humble appearance in a Toys 'R' Us commercial. Quickly identified as a talented actress, at five years old she starred in her first feature film, Signs, opposite Mel Gibson.</p><p>Aged 10, she was nominated for an Oscar for her role Olive in the hit film Little Miss Sunshine, pocketing a cheque for $1.5 million (£1 million) along the way. Now aged 14, she commands around $3 million (£1.5 million) a film. With an impressive list of roles behind her, she is now thought to be worth an estimated $12 million (£8 million).</p><h2 id=tyler-williams-18>Tyler Williams, 18</h2><p>"I'm good for three things," the Everybody Hates Chris star said on being cast in 2005 as the central character in this hit US comedy show. "Making fried-baloney sandwiches, picking out good movies and making money."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He's not wrong. With an estimated salary of $1.2 million (£810,000) per season, the opportunity to play the boyhood persona of US comedian Chris Rock has certainly paid off. Now 18, his career continues to develop with voice roles in the Ant Bully and the Batman franchise.</p><h2 id=india-rose-james-18>India Rose James, 18</h2><p>India Rose is the granddaughter of the late publisher Paul Raymond, who made his fortune through top-shelf magazines and property. He earned his first money by launching Raymond's Revue Bar in 1957, taking over the Whitehall Theatre in the 1960s and the Windmill Theatre in 1974, but it was his publishing empire that enabled him to fund his lucrative property investments.</p><p>Raymond died in March 2008, leaving an inheritance of £75 million in his will to India Rose and her sister Fawn. The family empire is said to be worth £500 million, with the sisters' share standing at around £120 million.</p><h2 id=nick-jonas-17>Nick Jonas, 17</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The youngest member of hit band The Jonas Brothers, Nick Jonas and his siblings earn around $12 million (£8.2 million) a year. Nick, who was born on 19 September 1992, originally attempted to be a solo singer, but record producers got his brothers Kevin and Joe involved after hearing them sing backup for him.</p><p>In the summer of 2008, the brothers starred in the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock. His current project is the band Nick Jonas & The Administration, which released its first album earlier this year.</p><h2 id=ianthe-fullagar-19>Ianthe Fullagar, 19</h2><p>Ianthe Fullagar is the 27th richest young person in Britain, according to the latest Sunday Times rich list. The 19-year-old from Ravenglass, West Cumbria, earned her fortune the easy way, by scooping a £7 million share of the EuroMillions lottery jackpot back in 2008.</p><p>She says she screamed so loudly when she won that it prompted her dog Brock to bite her on the bottom. Despite becoming a millionaire, Ianthe remains down to earth and has invested most of her fortune for the future rather than splashing out on new cars and houses.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=caroline-wozniacki-19>Caroline Wozniacki, 19</h2><p>The 19-year-old tennis player Caroline Wozniacki has netted more than $2.9 million (£1.98 million) in prize money in her short career, which has seen her win six tournaments. She is currently ranked the third-best female tennis player in the world.</p><p>Her recent winning streak ended in May this year, after she was knocked out of the French Open in the quarter finals by the oldest female player in the tournament, Francesca Schiavone, 29.</p><h2 id=angus-turner-jones-16>Angus Turner Jones, 16</h2><p>Child actor Angus started treading the boards when he was just four years old and is currently co-starring in the CBS show Two and a Half Men, where he plays the role of Jake Harper.</p><p>He first rose to fame when he was cast as James in the hit movie See Spot Run alongside David Arquette. His earnings are an estimated $1.2 million (£810,000) per season - not bad for a 16-year-old. He currently lives in Los Angeles with his parents, baby brother, dog, cat and bird.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=miley-cyrus-17>Miley Cyrus, 17</h2><p>Born on 23 November 1992 in Nashville, Tennessee, as Destiny Hope Cyrus, the 17-year-old daughter of country music singer Billy Ray Cyrus has already achieved more than most could hope to in a lifetime.</p><p>With a TV series, an animated movie and a hit recording career, including three number one albums, already under her belt, many are predicting that she could be on track to become a billionaire by the time she reaches the ripe old age of 18. Her 2008 concert tour alone raked in a not-insubstantial $17 million (£11.6 million).</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqttdKtZquhk52ytMCMrZyepqNif3F9kGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victoria-silvstedt-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Silvstedt Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./sexyy-red-gives-birth-and-is-ready-to-hit-da-block-wit-da-guys.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Sexyy Red Gives Birth And Is Ready To Hit Da Block Wit Da Guys</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
