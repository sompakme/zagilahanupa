He immediately moved to Los Angeles and began taking on minor roles. Pitt worked as a background actor until receiving his breakthrough with <i>Thelma & Louis</i>, which paved the way for him to take on more interesting roles and venture into various businesses. The actor has been bestowed with various awards, including an Oscar. <a href=#>While movies came to Pitt, the actor took it upon himself to work hard</a> and portray the role to perfection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The journey from being a background actor to a leading man was full of obstacles, but the actor remained optimistic about getting better results. Through his preparation, generosity, and ability to keep working, Pitt remains a sought-after actor in Hollywood even three decades after his debut. Let’s take a look at Brad Pitt’s top rules for success.</p><h2 id=being-optimistic-about-the-future>Being Optimistic About The Future</h2><p><i>Thelma & Louis</i> is an iconic movie that got Brad Pitt notoriety and the start of his career in Hollywood. The movie didn’t come easily to the actor as he had to beat out other talented young actors like Robert Downey Jr. and George Clooney to become the hitchhiker J.D. The actor only made $6,000 for his role but remained positive that the role would bring in more opportunities.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Mission Possible: These Are Tom Cruise's Top Rules For Success</a></span></p><h2 id=chase-your-dreams>Chase Your Dreams</h2><p>The actor made waves with his supporting roles in movies and continued working hard to become a leading man in Hollywood. In 1988, Pitt finally received the role of a lifetime with <i>The Dark Side of the Sun</i>, wherein he portrayed an Adriatic with a skin condition. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E Online</a>, the role didn’t come easily to him as he beat out 400 prospective candidates to snag the role and earned $1,523 in salary.</p><h2 id=focusing-on-mental-health-is-important>Focusing On Mental Health Is Important</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt went through a difficult few years after his public reputation had dwindled due to his family issues and legal battles. While he produced movies, Brad Pitt stayed relatively out of the public eye and focused on himself. He made a triumphant return to Hollywood in 2019 as stuntman Cliff Booth in <i>Once Upon A Time In Hollywood</i>, which won him his first acting Oscar.</p><h2 id=help-people-around-the-world>Help People Around The World</h2><p>Since the early 2010s, Brad Pitt has made generous donations and helped organizations through the Jolie-Pitt Foundation that <a href=#>he set up with his ex-wife Angelina Jolie</a>. Today, the actor does not hesitate to make donations to various charities. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, during the state protests after the death of George Floyd, he matched a $1 million donation to Color of Change with his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=going-the-extra-mile-for-work>Going The Extra Mile For Work</h2><p>Brad Pitt ensures that he makes each character his own with every role. While trying to memorize the script, he chooses one line that resonates with his character and uses it to bring his emotions onto the screen. Once the movie is wrapped up, he deletes the mental files of his character and moves to the next role.</p><h2 id=take-creative-decisions-when-necessary>Take Creative Decisions When Necessary</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt and David Fincher have collaborated on multiple projects together, and the partnership began with the crime thriller with 1995 thriller <i>Se7en</i>, wherein Pitt starred alongside Morgan Freeman and Gwyneth Paltrow. Before agreeing to start filming, Pitt made a creative decision about how he wanted the movie’s ending, and the production followed through with his request, as noted by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>.</p><h2 id=training-for-each-role>Training For Each Role</h2><p>While preparing for his role in <a href=#>David Fincher’s </a><a href=#><i>Fight Club</i></a>, co-starring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt took it upon himself to absorb into his character. For the role of Tyler Durden, Pitt took grappling lessons and practiced taekwondo. The actor also took up soap-making lessons and chipped his front teeth to make a complete transformation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=learn-to-make-choices>Learn To Make Choices</h2><p>While <i>Se7en</i> remains one of the most iconic works of Brad Pitt that still has mystery around it, the actor passed on the role in <i>Apollo 13</i> to become a part of this project. He chose to give up on historical drama over suspense thrillers. While his mother was disappointed about the role he gave up, the actor does not have any regrets as both movies are equally successful in their genres.</p><h2 id=making-the-right-physical-transformations-for-each-role>Making The Right Physical Transformations For Each Role</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt has always given physical transformations a priority while preparing for any role. The actor has taken on roles from a reverse-aging man to becoming a Greek god, and he never disappointed the audiences with his looks. In <i>Troy</i>, Brad Pitt achieved his greatest physique with muscular workouts, including glute hyperextensions, dumbbell rows, and T-bar rows, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a>.</p><h2 id=work-is-worship>Work Is Worship</h2><p>After being a part of Hollywood for over thirty years, Brad Pitt is nowhere close to retiring as an actor and producer. He continues to work on interesting projects and delves into every role, be it of a leading man or a supporting actor. Over the last few years, the actor has managed to give some of his career-best performances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Brad Pitt believes that practice and perfection can take time, but hard work can be an important part of the process. While making creative decisions and taking on roles, the actor wants to challenge himself with unique opportunities. The actor was last seen starring in the 2022 action thriller <i>Bullet Train</i>.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>A Look At The Rise And Fall Of R Kelly's Career</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">E Online</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elle</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Esquire</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBqbHSnmSaqpVir7Otw2anoqykqHq1u89maGlloqq5pr%2BMn6arZaOqsKSx0qxm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-went-wrong-a-look-back-at-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-s-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Went Wrong?
