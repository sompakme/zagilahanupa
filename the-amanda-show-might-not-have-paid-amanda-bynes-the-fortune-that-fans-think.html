It seems likely that she made a higher salary for her movies like Sydney White, She's The Man, and What A Girl Wants.</p><p>The Amanda Show was a showcase for the acting talents of many young stars who would also have their own shows on the network. Bynes starred alongside Josh Peck and Drake Bell, who then went on to star on Drake & Josh.</p><h2 id=what-was-the-amanda-show-about>What Was The Amanda Show About?</h2><p>The Amanda Show was so fun and interesting because it was a sketch show aimed at children and that idea was pretty unique.

Judge Trudy would say "Bring in the dancing lobsters" when she was finished and Bynes would wear a black robe with a white collar, glasses, and a curly brown wig.</p><p>Other memorable sketches include Mr. Gullible about a teacher whose students are always tricking him and The Girls' Room where characters Debbie, Tammy, Sheila, and Amber exchange gossip. Drake Bell and Josh Peck also played many characters, with Peck playing The Dancing Lobster 2.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Drake & Josh Was Canceled Despite Being One Nickelodeon's Biggest Hits</a></span></p><p>In her 2018 interview with Paper Magazine, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Amanda Bynes talked about The Amanda Show</a>.

This is where they first performed their Good Burger sketch that led to their 1997 movie. A few years later, The Amanda Show began airing.</p><p>Bynes was 13 years old when it started and her young age definitely appealed to viewers. It was easy for fans to feel like they were watching a peer or friend, especially someone who was very silly and goofy and seemed to enjoy every moment of the series. Bynes's energy was great and she gave her all to every sketch.</p><h2 id=amanda-bynes-39-s-comments-about-her-acting-career>Amanda Bynes's Comments About Her Acting Career</h2><p>It seems like Amanda Bynes had fun starring on The Amanda Show, and as she began acting in comedies afterward, it's clear that hilarious characters appealed to her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In an interview with 18 Doors around the time that she starred in the 2007 movie Hairspray, Bynes shared that she was happy to take on characters who reflected the age that she was at the time. She said, "I wouldn’t say that I was going to play any younger. I am going to do what works for me. I want to make people laugh and to find roles that are strong female roles—roles that I find challenging—for the time being I am content with the roles I have been doing."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's Why Amanda Bynes' Conservatorship Finally Came To An End</a></span></p><p>Many of Bynes's 2000s comedies definitely reflected the goofy sensibility of All That and The Amanda Show. This was particularly true of She's The Man but also applied to Sydney White, which came out in 2007.

She told 18 Doors, "Everything I do is a transition, because I am growing-up. I am doing roles that are suitable for me now. I’m 21 and it is fitting that I am doing a role that puts me in college because if I was in school, now, I would be in college."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/amanda-bynes-3.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When Amanda Bynes's conservatorship ended in March 2022, Bynes didn't mention wanting to act again.
