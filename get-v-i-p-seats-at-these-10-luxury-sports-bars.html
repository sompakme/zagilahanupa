The east coast is the first to make anything a real statement and they are doing that as we speak with sports bars. When most people think of sports bars, they think of dingy dive bars hidden in a back alley with stale pretzels on the table. Not that it’s a bad thing, some people really enjoy this kind of lifestyle. However, the east coast is creating the newest trend; luxury sports bars.</p><p>These sports bars are not your average run of the mill dive bars, some have their very own bouncer, valet service, and so much more. These trendy night spots are the new place to cheer for your favorite team, maybe while snacking on some caviar.</p><p>The next time you make it to the east coast, make sure to check out these lavish places next (that is, if you can get on the guest list in some places). They’re sure to be a hit, and they’re sure to treat you well.</p><h2 id=the-windsor><strong>The Windsor</strong></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This upscale sports bar won’t leave you disappointed.
