From his catchy tunes and <a href=#>killer fashion sense</a>, fans can’t get enough of the Georgia native.</p><p>His red carpet looks consist of neon suits, skirts and eye-catching shirtless moments. In a September 2022 interview with <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, Lil Nas X’s stylist, <strong>Hodo Musa</strong>, opened up about working with the rapper. “We both have inspired each other and brought the best out of each other,” she gushed. “Over the last few years, we have had so much fun trying new things and have slowly started to uncover who Lil Nas X is and how he likes to express himself.”</p><p>Together, Nas and Musa have created iconic looks on the red carpet. In a November 2021 interview with <a href=#>GQ Magazine</a>, Lil Nas X adorably called Musa “the best stylist of all time.”</p><p>One of the “Industry Baby” singer’s most iconic looks was his ensemble at the 2022 Met Gala. He arrived at fashion’s biggest night looking like a royal in a golden cape that beautifully covered his whole body. The custom Versace number was then transformed for his second look of the night – a shiny armor suit. The glamorous fit had built-in abs and shoulder pieces. Finally, for his last look of the night, the “Star Walkin’” singer donned a shimmery catsuit, perfectly sculpting his body.</p><p>For glam, Lil Nas X <a href=#>rocked a subtle eyeliner look</a>, gold jewelry and bedazzled teeth.</p><p>Another noteworthy look the Grammy award winner pulled off was his outfit at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards. The Harris Reed masterpiece included an <a href=#>extravagant headpiece that was the talk of the night</a>. The feathered halo matched the rest of his ensemble. He stunted a pair of sparkly trousers underneath a feathered hoop skirt. To complete the look, the “Lost in The Citadel” singer went shirtless.</p><p>The hitmaker drew inspiration from model <a href=#><strong>Iman</strong></a>’s 2021 Met Gala look. She also donned a gold Harris Reed headpiece and shimmery catsuit underneath.</p><p>Not only does the fashion mogul look fabulous in his outfits, but he also slays the beauty game. In August 2022, Lil Nas X <a href=#>became an ambassador for YSL Beauty</a>. According to the French fashion house, their collaboration is meant to show “self-expression for individuals and communities driven to change the world.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lil Nas X is undeniably a style icon, and we’re taking a look back at his most memorable moments on the red carpet.</p><p>Keep scrolling to see the Lil Nas X’s style evolution through the years:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6poJyspaeytHvLoqNmppGoerm%2FjJucrKxdqMG6uMRmpKillaPBtHnOn2SapJxiwaq5xGanopujZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./maria-bamford-s-net-worth-biography-career-awards-fact-and-life-story.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Maria Bamfords Net Worth, Biography, Career, Awards, Fact and Life Story</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-gordon-levitt-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Gordon-Levitt Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
