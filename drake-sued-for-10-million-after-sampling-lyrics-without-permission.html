However, it’s only causing controversy now.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Obrafour, a rapper from Ghana, filed the copyright infringement lawsuit, claiming Drake sampled vocals from his song "Oye Ohene,” where he says, "Killer cut, blood, killer cut.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Travis Barker Surprises Kourtney Kardashian With $160,000 Birthday Gift</a></span></p><p>According to court documents, someone from Drake’s team reached out to Obrafour via email last June to inquire about using a sample from his music. However, Obrafour says he never replied to the original message, nor did he respond to subsequent follow-ups.</p><p>Despite allegedly not having Obrafour’s permission to use the sample, Drake went on to release the album the same month featuring the track with Obrafour’s vocals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"This lack of alteration to the audio of the sampled phrase heard in the infringing work is notable to the extent that is generally atypical for a song to sample another without at least some audible manipulation, processing or other alteration to the basic character speed and/or pitch of the sample audio," <a href=#>Obrafour’s complaint argues</a> .</p><p>Obrafour is seeking a jury trial and hopes to win $10 million in damages. So far, Drake hasn’t publicly responded to the allegations.</p><p>Drake is no stranger to lawsuits. He recently settled a case with 21 Savage in February after the rappers were sued by Conde Nast for using a fake Vogue cover to promote their joint album Her Loss, which debuted in November 2022.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Conde Nast, the publisher behind Vogue, subsequently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the entertainers for not having the proper permission to use Vogue’s name to promote their album.</p><p>“Vogue magazine and its Editor-in-Chief Anna Wintour have had no involvement in Her Loss or its promotion, and have not endorsed it in any way,” <a href=#>Conde Nast said in a statement</a>.</p><p>“Nor did Condé Nast authorize, much less support, the creation and widespread dissemination of a counterfeit issue of Vogue, or a counterfeit version of perhaps one of the most carefully curated covers in all of the publication business,” it continued.</p><p>Not only did a judge agree to an injunction, which stopped Drake and 21 Savage from using Vogue to promote their album any further, but they also reached a undisclosed settlement outside of court.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>These Celebrities Are Paying For Twitter’s Blue Verification Checkmark</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Billboard</a>, <a href=#>XXL Magazine</a>,</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSxs63KnmSsrZWZeqe70WZoaWWdnrmttc6nZJqepJq%2Fbr%2FApqeloZ6ceq3F0aKarGWnnsGpu9StZKmdoqK2tL%2FIqKVo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joseph-gordon-levitt-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joseph Gordon-Levitt Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./breaking-down-garth-brooks-125-million-divorce-settlement.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Breaking Down Garth Brooks' $125 Million Divorce Settlement</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
