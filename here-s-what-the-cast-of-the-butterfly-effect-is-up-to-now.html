He played the title role in the Percy Jackson franchise. After years of keeping himself busy with movies, he made his comeback to television with Amazon Prime's series Hunters last year.

It was Ethan Suplee who brought the character to life. However, you may not recognize the actor should you ever accidentally bump into him on the street. Back in 2011, TMZ on TV reported Suplee's amazing weight loss of over 200 pounds. At one point, he even reached an all-time low of 9 percent body fat. Recently, he secured three cameo episodes in Good Girls and ventured into voice-acting in Disney Jr.'s&nbsp; Vampirina.</p><h2 id=elden-henson><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Elden Henson</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Elden.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elden Henson starred as the adult version of Evan's friend Lenny.

He's a "victim" of typecasting, meaning that he is frequently cast as a bad guy in movies and series. A proud Canadian at heart, Rennie is also an avid golfer and hockey player.
