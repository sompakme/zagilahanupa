Page Six also reported that Bündchen kept the family's home in Costa Rica. She also kept the NYC apartment, but no word on what happened to their home at the Yellowstone Club in Montana.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/How-Tom-Brady--Gisele-Bundchen-Parent-Their-Children.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>The Real Reason Tom Brady And Gisele Bündchen's Potential Divorce Settlement Might Get Very Messy</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Despite the fact that Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen have a prenup in place, there are a lot of unanswered settlement questions.</span><p>Gisele Bündchen and Tom Brady’s divorce settlement was also the easiest, with the couple revising their prenup months before their actual divorce.
