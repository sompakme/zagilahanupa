Since the age of 16, he had been training with Joe DeFranco at the DeFranco’s Training Systems gym in Wyckoff, New Jersey.</p><p>By happenstance, WWE executive Triple H began exercising with DeFranco as well; Arndt, a lifetime admirer of professional wrestling, created a compilation film of himself doing various exercises and cutting a promo.</p><p>When DeFranco showed Triple H the footage, Arndt was offered a tryout at WWE, which led to his signing. Arndt was signed by WWE in August 2012, and he began using the ring name, Eric Anthony. When he debuted as a wrestler in WWE’s developmental system NXT in November 2012, he was given the ring name Enzo Amore.</p><h4><span>Teaming with Big Cass (2013–2017)</span></h4><p>Amore made his NXT television debut as a villain on May 22, 2013, being labeled as a “stereotypical cocky, Jersey Shore loudmouth” and a “outsized version of the man performing the part,” when he was squashed by Mason Ryan. Amore went on to create an alliance with Colin Cassady, who had also lost to Ryan, on the July 3 episode of NXT, and they dubbed themselves “the most real dudes in the room.”</p><p>Despite Amore and Cassady’s cooperation, Ryan comfortably defeated them in successive singles matches in July but lost a handicap match to them. Following their battle with Ryan, Amore and Cassady went on to feud with Alexander Rusev, Scott Dawson, and their manager Sylvester Lefort, eventually turning face.</p><p>On the September 25 episode of NXT, Amore and Cassady competed in a gauntlet match for a future opportunity at the NXT Tag Team Championship; they began the battle by defeating CJ Parker and Tyler Breeze, then Rusev and Dawson, before falling to The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor).</p><p>Amore fractured his leg during training in November 2013. According to Simon Gotch, a fellow wrestler who was also contracted to NXT at the time, Amore “He injured his own leg while attempting to break a wristlock. He blamed it on the sagging canvas.” On the June 26, 2014 episode of NXT, Amore returned to save Cassady from an onslaught by Sylvester Lefort and Marcus Louis.</p><p>Amore and Cassady competed in the NXT Tag Team Championship tournament in early August. They defeated Jason Jordan and Tye Dillinger in the first round, but were ousted in the second round by The Vaudevillains (Aiden English and Simon Gotch).</p><p>Lefort and Louis then rekindled their feud with Amore and Cassady by attacking and shaving Amore’s beard. As a result, Amore challenged Lefort to a match at NXT TakeOver: Fatal 4-Way with the loser’s hair as a forfeit, which Amore won, but Lefort ran away, causing his companion Louis to lose his hair and eyebrows. Amore and Cassady then established an alliance with Carmella, who was making her debut.</p><p>Carmella’s hairdressing job had been accidentally lost due to the duo’s error, prompting her to seek a position as a wrestler. Carmella made her televised in-ring debut on NXT on October 16, 2014.</p><p>Amore and Cassady defeated The Lucha Dragons on the March 11, 2015 edition of NXT to become the number one contender for the NXT Tag Team Championship. At NXT TakeOver: Unstoppable, Amore and Cassady competed for the title against Blake and Murphy, but lost due to interference from Alexa Bliss.</p><p>Amore and Cassady began a feud with Dash and Dawson in December, challenging them for the NXT Tag Team Championship at both NXT TakeOver: London and Roadblock, but were unsuccessful. On the <i>Raw</i> after WrestleMania 32, Amore and Cassady debuted on the main roster and confronted The Dudley Boyz.</p><p>On SmackDown a week later, Amore and Cassady defeated The Ascension in a tournament to become the top contenders for the WWE Tag Team Championship. The team went on to defeat The Dudley Boyz in the tag team tournament semi-finals on the following week’s Raw, advancing them to the finals.</p><p>They faced the Vaudevillains in the finals at Payback, but the match ended in a no-contest after Amore received a legitimate concussion during the bout. At Money in the Bank, Enzo and Cass fought The New Day, The Vaudevillains, Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, and The Vaudevillains in a fatal four-way tag team match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, which The New Day won.</p><p>On the July 4 edition of Raw, Enzo and Cass assisted John Cena, who was being attacked by The Club (AJ Styles, Luke Gallows, and Karl Anderson), thereby inserting themselves in Cena’s feud with The Club. Enzo and Cass teamed up with Cena to defeat The Club in a six-man tag team bout at Battleground.</p><p>Enzo and Cass were recruited to the Raw brand by WWE on July 19, 2016. Enzo and Cass then feuded with Chris Jericho and Kevin Owens, culminating in a loss to Jericho and Owens at SummerSlam.</p><p>On the November 7 episode of Raw, Enzo and Cass joined Team Raw for the Survivor Series Tag Team Elimination match, which Team Raw won over Team Smac.</p><p>On the November 21 episode of Raw, after Amore was locked out of the locker room nude as a practical joke by Cass and ran into Lana in the corridor, her husband Rusev challenged Amore to about later that night, which Amore promptly lost.</p><p>Lana summoned Amore to her hotel room on the December 5 edition of Raw after Amore stood up for her after seeing her and Rusev dispute backstage. When Rusev attacked Amore in the hotel room later that night, it was discovered that this was a trap.</p><p>Enzo and Cass feuded with Rusev and Jinder Mahal in the weeks that followed. On January 29, 2017, Amore entered the Royal Rumble match as number 27, but was eliminated by Brock Lesnar.</p><p>At WrestleMania 33, Enzo and Cass faced reigning champions Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson, Cesaro and Sheamus, and the returning The Hardy Boyz in a fatal four-way ladder match for the Raw Tag Team Championship, which The Hardy Boyz won.</p><p>The following night on Raw, Amore, and Cass were defeated by Cesaro and Sheamus in a tag team battle to determine the Raw Tag Team Championship number one contenders. Amore was found unconscious backstage on the May 22 broadcast of Raw after being hit from behind by an unknown assailant, and he was found unconscious again the following week.</p><p>Big Cass then accused The Revival, who had been spotted in the background following the attacks. Cass was discovered knocked down backstage in the same manner as Amore on the June 5 episode of Raw.</p><p>Later, Cass claimed he wasn’t cleared to wrestle, so Amore teamed with Big Show to win a bout against Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson. Cass was found unconscious backstage the following week. He stated the perpetrator must have used a massive fist and implicated Big Show, who denied being the attacker.</p><p>On the June 19 edition of Raw, General Manager Kurt Angle sought to identify the attacker before surveillance footage discovered by Corey Graves revealed that Cass had staged his own attack to avoid suspicion. Cass stated as much, admitting his dissatisfaction with his time working with Amore.</p><p>Cass then attacked Amore, effectively dissolving the team. On the June 26 episode of Raw, Amore summoned Cass to the ring, and the two appeared to reconcile; nevertheless, Cass violently attacked Amore on the stage once more.</p><p>Cass defeated Amore at the Great Balls of Fire pay-per-view. Cass defeated Big Show at SummerSlam while Amore was hanging above the ring inside a shark cage. Amore escaped from the shark cage during the match, but was shortly attacked by Cass.</p><p>The following night, on the August 21 episode of Raw, Amore challenged Cass to a Street Fight, which he won after the referee called a halt to the battle due to Cass’ actual knee injury.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=music></span><span>Music</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Arndt began pursuing a career as a rapper under the stage moniker Real1 in May 2018, releasing his first song named “Phoenix” through WorldStarHipHop on May 28, 2018.
