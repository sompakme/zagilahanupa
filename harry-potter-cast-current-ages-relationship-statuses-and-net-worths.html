Almost all the young stars made an appearance in the reunion special, and it is clear that, while they have all moved on with their lives, none of them will ever forget the experience of starring in this iconic franchise. Many of the stars have exciting new projects coming out soon, including Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint, but they were clearly thrilled to take some time out of their busy schedules to appear in the reunion special.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Radcliffe will appear in the upcoming blockbuster The Lost City alongside Channing Tatum and Sandra Bullock.

K. Rowling. The world of Harry Potter is so magical and mystical and Daniel Radcliffe is the face everyone recognizes when we think of it! In real life, he is 32 years old, dating a woman named Erin Darke, and living life with a net worth of $110 million. It is actually pretty shocking that he is not worth more after all of his years playing Harry Potter, but then again, he's mostly worked on <a href=#>small-budget indie films</a> since his days as Harry Potter ended.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=emma-watson-mdash-age-31-dating-leo-robinton-net-worth-85-million><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Emma Watson — Age 31, Dating Leo Robinton, Net Worth $85 Million</span></h2><p>The lovely and talented Emma Watson is 31 years old and dating a man named Leo Robinton.

He was such an adorable, dorky, shy little kid when the movies started, but by the end, it was obvious that he had gained more confidence! Rupert Grint is 33 years old and dating a woman named Georgia Groome. He has a nice net worth of $50 million as it stands today. His time in the Harry Potter movie franchise will be a defining factor in his life.</p><h2 id=tom-felton-mdash-age-34-single-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tom Felton — Age 34, Single, Net Worth $20 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tom Felton is a single man at 34 years old. He played the role of one of the worst bullies of all time in the Harry Potter movie franchise, Draco Malfoy. He was so mean to Harry Potter throughout the movies that it was hard to ever be on his side! The Harry Potter movies have been <a href=#>occasionally considered inappropriate</a> and Draco's constant bullying could be a huge reason why.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>5 Actors Who Hated Their Time On Harry Potter (And 10 Who Loved It)</a></span></p><p>In real life, Tom Felton is nothing like the character he played in the movies.

Luna Lovegood was definitely a weirdo, but she always had good intentions, so it was easy to like her as a character. Her bright blonde hair and ghostly white skin made her a super recognizable character as well. Evanna Lynch is 30 years old, dating a man named Robbie Jarvis, and living life with a net worth of $4 million.</p><h2 id=maggie-smith-mdash-age-87-widowed-net-worth-20-million><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Maggie Smith — Age 87, Widowed, Net Worth $20 Million</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As crazy as it sounds, Maggie Smith is actually 87 years old! Sadly, she has been a widow since 1998. She is one of the most memorable and recognized professors to come from Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. She was actually a teacher who had good intentions and wanted to take care of her students.

She is such a great actress because of how eccentric she is! She used to be married to Tim Burton from 2001 to 2014, but that marriage did not last.
