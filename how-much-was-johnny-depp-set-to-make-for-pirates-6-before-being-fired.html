Many actors would have been satisfied with this, but not Depp. Instead, he set his sights for the big screen, and once he got his chance to shine, he developed into a star that people could not get enough of.</p><p>Whether he was turning heads as Edward Scissorhands, wowing audiences in movies like Blow, or was functioning as more of a heartthrob in Cry-Baby, Depp proved that he could do it all, and do it well.</p><p>The actor has had many iconic roles and projects, but few comes anywhere close to matching what he achieved during his time as a swashbuckling pirate.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's How Johnny Depp Reacted To Meeting Jim Carrey For The First Time</a></span></p><h2 id=johnny-depp-39-s-time-as-captain-jack-sparrow-made-him-millions>Johnny Depp's Time As Captain Jack Sparrow Made Him Millions</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>2003's Pirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl was a surprise hit at the box office, and in the blink of an eye, Disney had a massive live-action franchise on its hands. It was truly a once-in-a-lifetime idea that worked, and Johnny Depp's Captain Jack Sparrow was the main attraction.</p><p>Depp could not have been a better choice for the role, and he would star in a total of five Pirates movies that contributed to billions of dollars at the box office.</p><p>Thanks to the success of the films and the popularity of Captain Jack Sparrow, Johnny Depp made a fortune.</p><p>"For his first appearance as "Jack Sparrow" in 2003's "Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl", Johnny earned $10 million. His base salary for the second "Pirates" installment was $20 million. With backend points her earned an additional $40 million for a total of $60 million.

A lot has been revealed, including the amount of money that Depp was supposed to make for a 6th Pirates of the Caribbean movie.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>, "The manager, Jack Whigham, said in Depp's defamation trial against his ex-wife that Disney's movie chief Sean Bailey and "Pirates of the Caribbean" producer Jerry Bruckheimer verbally sealed a deal in around 2016 to pay Depp $22.5 million for the sixth movie in the series. But Depp never got to see those million. The sixth "Pirates" movie was never filmed, and Depp never got to reprise his role as Captain Jack Sparrow."</p><p>That is an unthinkable amount of money to lose out on, and it's just one of many ways that the involved parties have been effected during this turbulent time.</p><p>Depp wanted to reprise Captain Jack Sparrow one more time as a send-off, but this opportunity was taken from him.</p><p>"My feeling was that these characters should be able to have their proper goodbye, as it were. A franchise can only last for so long and there's a way to end a franchise like that and I thought that the characters deserved to have their way out, to end the franchise on a very good note. I planned on continuing until it was time to stop," the actor said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>It Took Johnny Depp 22-Hours To Transform For This Role</a></span></p><p>Johnny Depp's case is still moving along, and fans will be tuning in to see what else gets revealed during these proceedings.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Here's How Johnny Depp Would Constantly Troll David Letterman During Interviews</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGihqKCeo8ZusMSpp2aomaeutbHSZm1mq5GhrrPFjJucn6eimnqjscinnmaemaeypXs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jooshica-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jooshica Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./demian-maia-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Demian Maia Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
