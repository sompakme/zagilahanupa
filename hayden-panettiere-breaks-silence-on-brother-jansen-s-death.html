A cause of death was not immediately revealed, but the Panettiere family later issued a statement addressing the circumstances of Jansen’s passing.</p><p>“Though it offers little solace, the Medical Examiner reported Jansen’s sudden passing was due to cardiomegaly (enlarged heart), coupled with aortic valve complications,” <a href=#>read a statement from Hayden, mother <strong>Lesley Vogel</strong> and father <strong>Skip Panettiere</strong></a> on February 27.</p><p>The family continued: “Jansen’s heart could be seen in his eyes, and his charm in his brilliant, engaging smile; his soul in his masterful and revealing paintings, and the joy of life in his dry wit. His charisma, warmth, compassion for others, and his creative spirit will live forever in our hearts and in the hearts of all whom he encountered.”</p><p>Jansen appeared in projects such as Even Stevens, Blue’s Clues, Ice Age: The Meltdown and Robots. He went on to land roles in Everybody Hates Chris, The Babysitters, The Perfect Game and Summer Forever.</p><p>The New York native’s final onscreen job before his passing was the role of Casper on AMC’s The Walking Dead in 2019. Since then, Jansen <a href=#>moved on to a career in graffiti art</a>, which he often shared on his social media.</p><p>The <a href=#>former Nickelodeon star also offered a glimpse at his close-knit bond</a> with Hayden before his death. “Not the first haircut she’s tried to give me,” Jansen captioned an Instagram photo in January of him and his older sister spending time together.</p><p>Hayden and Jansen previously worked on screen in films such as Tiger Cruise and Racing Stripes. The <a href=#>Scream</a> actress showed her support for her brother’s acting career when he appeared in the 2007 film The Last Day of Summer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Hayden-Panettiere-Breaks-Her-Silence-on-Brother-Jansen-Panettieres-Death-2.jpg><p>At the time, the brother and sister duo opened up about their dynamic during a joint interview. “She gets me a little more noticed. She gives me a kick-start. With The Last Day of Summer, they will notice me more because she is my sister,” Jansen told TV Guide in 2007. “It is almost like you are looking in a book, and the bookmark is my sister and she is basically showing me, she is able to push me out there. She helps me tremendously.”</p><p>The Heroes alum, for her part, noted <a href=#>the lessons she learned from Jansen over the years</a>.</p><p>“He is a very balanced child. He has a heart of gold and would never wish bad on anyone. Sometimes I need to take a lesson from him. He keeps his cool really well,” she added at the time. “Watching him, because he is such a kid, you realize sometimes how down you are and for absolutely no reason. I guess it is just that it is very difficult for kids in this business.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Hayden has <a href=#>had her fair share of ups and downs through the years</a>. She previously opened up about <a href=#>seeking treatment for postpartum depression</a> after welcoming daughter Kaya with then-fiancé <a href=#><strong>Wladimir Klitschko</strong></a>&nbsp;in December 2014. The former couple’s child <a href=#>remained with her father after they called it quits.</a></p><p>Following her split from Klitschko, 46, the Golden Globe nominee <a href=#>made headlines after then-boyfriend <strong>Brian Hickerson</strong></a> was arrested for domestic violence against her in May 2019. The case against Hickerson, 32, was ultimately dropped and the duo broke up after another domestic violence incident in February 2020.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahmamZsq95z5qlnqyknrKzsYybqZ6Zm6h6tLXLnqWcnV2ku26u0airoZ2iYreiutKepaxllJqutbSO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jenna-fischer-net-worth-how-much-is-fischer-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jenna Fischer Net Worth How Much is Fischer Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./hannah-meloche-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Hannah Meloche Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
