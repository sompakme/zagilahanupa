News</a> on Wednesday, January 24. “It’s the biggest mistake I ever made in my career, and I’ve told this to Reese, not playing that part in that movie. So, sometimes you have to take the adventure and run with it.”</p><p>Sheindlin is referring to the role of Judge Marina R. Bickford, who was ultimately played by actress <strong>Francesca P. Roberts</strong> in the 2001 film. The judge presided over the third act murder trial, which Witherspoon’s Elle Woods won through her knowledge of perm hair care.</p><p>On Wednesday, Sheindlin made it clear that she has nothing but kind words about Witherspoon, 47. “I think Reese is a fabulous woman,” she shared.</p><p>Sheindlin is such a big fan of the Oscar winner that she named her as the actress she wants to portray her in a biopic. “We’re friends, and she gets me, and I know she does,” the TV personality previously told <a href=# rel=noopener>E! News</a> back in November 2022. “And I think she’s a great actress, and I think she could—if they did, which I would not like—I think that she could carry that off.”</p><p>Witherspoon, for her part, is down for the challenge “I don’t even have to think about it,” she <a href=# rel=noopener>told the outlet</a>. “Yes, I’m in. Judy, call me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Judge-Judy-Reveals-Her-One-Regret-Is-Passing-on-a-Legally-Blonde-Cameo-The-Biggest-Mistake-2.jpg><p>The <a href=#>Morning Show</a> actress went on to gush about her “love” for Sheindlin, stating, “I mean, she’s my girlfriend. I’m obsessed with her. I love her book that’s called Beauty Fades, Dumb Is Forever. Classic book. She just gives out great information and knowledge and she’s just one of those truly wise people that you want around, you know?”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Sheindlin may get a chance to share the screen with Witherspoon in the future as a third Legally Blonde film is currently in the works — though it’s been a minute since there has been an update on the script. <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> confirmed in May 2020 that the movie had been given the greenlight and that Witherspoon would reprise her role as Elle Woods. Witherspoon’s A Wrinkle in Time costar <strong>Mindy Kaling</strong> is set to cowrite the project with <strong>Dan Goor</strong>.</p><p>“I love this project. I am so excited about it. We are working on it,” Kaling, 44, told <a href=# rel=noopener>Entertainment Tonight</a> in April 2022. “It is going, you know, a little more slowly than we like but [it’s] just because we really want it to be good.”</p><p>Later that year, Witherspoon told <a href=# rel=noopener>USA Today</a> that she hopes Legally Blonde 3 “come[s] together in the right way,” adding, “It’s just like Top Gun: They waited a long time to make another version of that movie, and I loved the nostalgia piece they incorporated in it,” she explained in July 2022. “So definitely that gave us a lot of inspiration about what we would want to do with Elle Woods and make sure that we had all those same touchstones that mattered to people [back] then.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGunJeaeqvBw7KqZpqZnLSmv9NmpKKrpJa4pnnIrGSpmaOotq%2BzjKilZpldobKorculsGaanKS7pbGMnJimnZ9k</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-10-richest-female-talk-show-hosts.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top 10 Richest Female Talk Show Hosts</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-aniston-had-this-to-say-about-her-nipples-showing-on-friends.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Aniston Had This to Say About Her Nipples Showing on Friends</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
