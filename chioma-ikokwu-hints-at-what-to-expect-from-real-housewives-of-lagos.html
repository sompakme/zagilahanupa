While I'd seen a little bit of <strong>Real Housewives of Atlanta</strong> and <strong>Real Housewives of Beverly Hills</strong> , I wasn't a huge fan, per se, so I really didn't know what to expect."</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: What Drew Sidora Wishes She Knew Before Becoming A Real Housewife</a></span></p><p>On top of not knowing too much about the franchise, Chioma adds that she also had zero television experience, prior to joining the cast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It was my first time ever really doing anything with reality TV, or TV in general."</p><p>That said, she doesn't necessarily believe that was much of a problem. Far from it, she explains, <strong>"I was quite open, going in."</strong></p><p>However, aside from the openness, she laughs that going in, she was simply, <strong>"Hoping for the best."</strong></p><h2 id=chioma-promises-that-season-1-is-a-slice-of-life>Chioma Promises That Season 1 Is A Slice Of Life</h2><p>As for what fans can expect to see, Chioma reveals that if anything, Season 1 shines a spotlight on real-life dynamics and the ever evolving nature of friendships.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You'll get to see the way a bunch of women can come together - because we didn't really know each other prior to filming. I mean, some people kind of knew each other, but we weren't a group of friends prior to the show. For me, anyway, I'd just met most of the ladies for the first time, so you're really seeing us coming into a new friendship circle and how we interact through the highs, the lows, the ups and the downs. I guess it showcases the reality of life."</p><p>For Chioma, she believes that will be something audiences everywhere can resonate with.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Ashley Darby Shares The Biggest Lesson She's Learned As A Real Housewife</a></span></p><p>"Most people in real life do go through the sorts of situations we're going through on the show. So, just seeing it on your TV screen - things you can relate to, situations that may have happened in your life or friendship circles and just seeing the way we handled it - I think it will be interesting for people to see that."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chioma-reveals-that-season-1-shines-a-spotlight-on-the-strength-of-nigerian-women>Chioma Reveals That Season 1 Shines A Spotlight On The Strength Of Nigerian Women</h2><p>Another thing Chioma thinks fans will be taken in by, this season? The strength of Nigerian women.</p><p>"You get to see the entrepreneurial spirit of the Nigerian woman, and how strong we are - and you'll see that it's not a myth. It's actually real - we are extremely strong, powerful, independent women regardless of if we're married with kids or not."</p><p><strong>"We're just strong in our own right," </strong>she continues.</p><h2 id=chioma-summarizes-the-spirit-of-season-1>Chioma Summarizes The Spirit Of Season 1</h2><p>So, how would Chioma describe the first season of Real Housewives of Lagos?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Exclusive: Ashley Darby Reveals What She's Most Nervous For Fans To See, This Season On RHOP</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>She pauses a moment, before smiling, <strong>"A little bit of everything."</strong></p><p>"Season 1 definitely takes you on a whirlwind journey. You see friendships form, you see friendships dissolve, you see love, you see loss, you see fashion, you see etiquette, you see a lot of drama. You see language, and the way women come together."</p><p>In other words, Real Housewives of Lagos has it all!</p><p>Catch up on episodes of Real Housewives of Lagos every Saturday on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hayu</a>.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Exclusive: Wendy Osefo Speaks About her Upcoming Book (And The Details Set To Surprise Fans Most)</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiaoaGfoq5utcqoorCtXZ67tbHRr6Cer12staLAjK2mZp2opbKkwIyfqailXaeyoriMoaauq5Wstrex0mamn2WclrSwv44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./geena-davis-fianc%C3%A9-net-worth-tattoos-smoking-body-measurements.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Geena Davis: Fianc, net worth, tattoos, smoking &amp;amp; body measurements</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bradley-beal-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bradley Beal Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
