The physical growth and maturation is something that always astounds people. Predictably, the most amazing transformations take place in the child actors who disappeared from the limelight while they aged through their formative years. We remember them from one role or a few specific roles as children and then there was nothing until, BAM, they're adults. Well, child stars are all well and good, but what about the babies? What ever happened to those famous babies from TV and film? What kind of people did they grow into? Did they continue acting? These are the questions we have.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For child actors, the ones with speaking lines and some training, staying in the industry is very difficult. Only a small group are able to sustain a career and only a handful ever really stay successful. For babies, it's almost impossible. We went through and selected a group of babies from big TV shows and films, babies that we all remember seeing. Since babies and little toddlers are so unpredictable, most characters are acted by twins. This allows the film crew to get the most out of very short attention spans and sporadic mood shifts. Today, these baby actors look nothing like they used to. If they did look like a baby still, that would be pretty weird. We did choose some contemporary films and shows, so some of the actors on this list are still very young, but they're no longer babies. Since many of these baby actors never stuck in the industry, it was hard to track some of them down, which is why you have many claiming that the Look Who's Talking actor, Jacob Haines, is the same guy from One Tree Hill. Are we to expect that a kid born in 1988 all of sudden aged 10 years? No. We've collected real information. Here are 15 Movie and TV Babies and What They Look Like Today.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-pubert-addams---addams-family-values><strong>15. Pubert Addams - Addams Family Values</strong></h2><p>Pubert is the youngest of the Addams Family children. The one who's not Wednesday or Pugsley if you're drawing a blank. The one who's a baby. Just look at the picture. Pubert is the baby with the Gomez-style mustache. In the original show from the 60s, the name Pubert almost never was put forth because the creators thought it would just be censored. It probably should have been. Though Pubert was a baby boy, he was actually played by two twin girls, Kristen and Kaitlyn Hooper, in Addams Family Values. Confusingly, IMDb has these girls listed as playing Gracie and Claire Taylor on Home Improvement years later, but they also have other actresses listed in the parts. It seems that this is wrong and that the Hooper twins never acted again. We do know that they're 26-years old and they played softball. They also seem to like pyjamas. Only the hard facts here.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-sly-and-whit---baby-geniuses><strong>14. Sly and Whit - Baby Geniuses</strong></h2><p>The original film, Baby Geniuses, was terrible but in a so-bad-it's-good kind of way. The main twin characters, Sly and Whit, were pretty good in the film. They weren't babies, but they were close enough. For the purposes of this list, if you still poo your pants, you're a baby. The main twin characters in Baby Geniuses were actually played by triplets, Leo, Myles, and Gerry Fitzgerald. While the three of these actors are currently enrolled in Bemidji State University, they did act again after their film debut. All three came back for the sequel, Superbabies: Baby Geniuses 2, which is pretty close to being the worst movie of all time. In their return, they played Kahuna, basically the Zordon to the Baby Geniuses Power Rangers. You get it. A couple of the brothers also appeared in another film a few years back, so the dream is still alive.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-julie---look-who-s-talking-now><strong>13. Julie - Look Who's Talking Now</strong></h2><p>As we mentioned up top, the actor who played Mikey in Look Who's Talking has been part of a mystery. There are two Jacob Haines, the name of the baby actor. The one from Look Who's Talking never acted again. Another Jacob Haines, who is currently an actor, is getting all the credit, but he is 10 years older than the real Mikey. Having addressed that, we didn't want to ignore the franchise altogether. In Look Who's Talking Too, there were three babies who played Julie, none of which still act or have any online presence. For that reason, we thought we would focus on Look Who's Talking Now. Even though Julie was three years old during the filming, the actress who played her, Tabitha Lupien was awesome and deserves some love. Who cares if she is an old-timer compared to most on this list? Lupien still acts today, though mainly in shorts. After Look Who's Talking Now, she went on to act in The Santa Clause, Ready or Not and Hairspray. That's an impressive resume even if she was only ever background noise.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-nathan-jr---raising-arizona><strong>12. Nathan Jr. - Raising Arizona</strong></h2><p>After playing the baby in Raising Arizona, Nathan Jr., the baby actor, TJ Kuhn, never did act again. He says that growing up, the role embarrassed him, as if having <a href=#>Nicolas Cage</a> in his prime make baby noises to you is embarrassing. The audacity. Nowadays, Kuhn is a real estate agent. He probably isn't embarrassed anymore. He probably drops that knowledge on every client he meets with. And this room over here would be great to settle down in and watch a movie, maybe Raising Arizona? Damn that baby's cute, isn't he? There was another baby who split time with Kuhn, pretty much TJ's stunt double, which is another way of saying he was less important or too ugly for close-ups. His name was Cody Ranger, but no one knows anything about him. Kuhn's most interesting story from the shoot is that he "threw up in Julie's [the baby handler's] mouth while she was holding me over her head." Gross.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-emma-friends><strong>11. Emma – Friends</strong></h2><p>While Ben may have taken the majority of the limelight available to children on Friends, he kind of disappeared as soon as Emma, Ross and Rachel's baby, came into the picture. Emma was played by baby actors, Cali and Noelle Sheldon, identical twins who are 13 years old these days. After Friends, the Sheldon sisters went on to act in another show for one episode, Life, and the film, Novel Romance. Since those baby years, the Sheldons have acted in several short films but nothing too major. Though the girls are still interested in acting, they admit it's more of a hobby than a future career. Obviously neither twin has memories of the show. In fact, it wasn’t until much later that they even realized how big the show really was. "I grew up knowing that I was on Friends, but I didn’t realize the extent of it until I was probably 10," said Noelle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=10-baby-clark-kent-superman><strong>10. Baby Clark Kent – Superman</strong></h2><p>OK, so Aaron Smolinksi wasn't a baby when he appeared in Superman. He was about three years when he played baby Clark Kent. The actual baby who played Kal-El was Lee Quigley but, sadly, he died when he was only 15. Interestingly, Smolinksi also appeared in Superman III and Man of Steel. While he only appears in a role every few years, Smolinski does have an impressive resume, including appearances in The Outer Limits and the amazing film, MVP: Most Valuable Primate, the one where the monkey plays hockey. Compared to most of the babies on this list, Smolinski is an industry powerhouse.</p><h2 id=9-adam-szalinski---honey-i-blew-up-the-kids><strong>9. Adam Szalinski - Honey, I Blew Up the Kids</strong></h2><p>Despite the confusing title, Honey, I Blew Up the Kids, <a href=#>Rick Moranis</a> did not kill his children in the sequel to Honey, I Shrunk the Kids, he just made them larger. The giant baby in the film, Adam, is played by twins, Joshua and Daniel Shalikar. They both grew into techies and never did any acting after this movie. Like most twin baby actors, one would shoot a scene while the other was eating or napping and then they would switch. They were both nominated for a Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor, which shows how great these two little rugrats were. Today, the Shalikar brothers are 28-years old and living in New Jersey.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-elora-willow><strong>8. Elora – Willow</strong></h2><p>The only two babies to get credit for playing Elora Danan in Willow were the twins, Kate and Ruth Greenfield, but the information on those two is very limited. Rebecca Bearman, however, another baby actor that got some important, albeit uncredited, time as baby Elora has spoken about the role since. “I was used at the last-minute because I was told [the Greenfields] had grown too big for the backpack that Willow wears,” Bearman said. “I was generally a good child so I didn’t cry,” she added. “They needed me to cry when I’m in the back of a cart, because I’m meant to be terrified, but I was laughing the whole time. They had to give me my bottle and take it away to try and force me to cry. My Mum did more of the acting than I did!” While the Greenfields never did act again, Bearman went on to do some work as a teenager, but she felt the actor's life was too lonely and travel-heavy to ever pursue it full time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-bink---baby-s-day-out><strong>7. Bink - Baby's Day Out</strong></h2><p>The film Baby's Day Out was that strange movie about a baby who gets kidnapped and then escapes and has a trip out on the town alone. The baby who is nicknamed Bink, which is actually better than his real name Bennington, was played by twins Adam Robert Worton and Jacob Joseph Worton. The Worton twins never did act again after their big break. Little is known about these two brothers except that the one, Jacob, is a musician. Basically, this means they peaked way too early. This isn't all that bad because when you're a movie star before the age of two, you're going to have a hard time sustaining that kind of lifestyle.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-mary---three-men-and-a-baby><strong>6. Mary - Three Men and a Baby</strong></h2><p>Played by twins Lisa Blair and Michelle Blair Ontonovich, Mary was the baby in Three Men and a Baby. While working alongside <a href=#>Tom Selleck</a>, <a href=#>Ted Danson</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Steve Gutenberg </a>would be nerve-wracking for most, the Blair twins were pros. Well, actually, they were babies and don’t even remember it, but the director, <a href=#>Leonard Nimoy</a>,&nbsp;knew they were special. For one sequence, the film team built a contraption that would make it seem like the baby had peed on Selleck, but, when it came time to shoot, the device failed. Still, whichever one of the sisters were in the shot peed for real right on cue. "When we were little, it wasn't a big deal to us at all," said Michelle, speaking about the acting not the peeing. Michelle now works in insurance and says the fame never hit them until they were older. "I think it was when we became teenagers and people started coming up to us a lot more," she said.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-baby-carlos---the-hangover><strong>5. Baby Carlos - The Hangover</strong></h2><p>Remember the baby that <a href=#>Zack Galifinakis </a>carried around in The Hangover? That was baby Carlos, played by twins Grant and Avery Holmquist. Compared to most babies in film, Carlos was put in some strange and awkward situations, such as being left in a car with the window cracked and being forced to fake masturbate. When the director, Todd Phillips, asked the parents for permission to do these kind of things, he learned that dad was ok with the funny stuff, whereas mom would rather not be on the hook for those decisions. Phillips remembers, “I go to the dad: ‘It would be funny if Zach pretends to do this. Would you have a problem with that?’ And he literally goes: ‘[My wife is] going to be gone for a half-hour. Can you do it in the next half-hour?’” Amazingly, when Hangover III was being cast, Grant, one half of the original actors, came out to audition for the six-year-old version of Carlos. It was meant to be, so Phillips cast him again.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-gage---pet-sematary><strong>4. Gage - Pet Sematary</strong></h2><p><a href=#>Miko Hughes</a>, the actor who played Gage in Pet Sematary might be one of the most famous toddler actors there is. After his debut in Pet Sematary, Hughes appeared in Kindergarten Cop, several massive TV shows, like Beverly Hills, 90210, Doogie Howser, M.D., and Melrose Place. He took a bit of break from acting and only took on a few tiny parts, but he seems to be back in the industry full-time with three movies on the horizon. Miko was two when they filmed Pet Sematary, so calling him a baby is a stretch, but it's not like he was stringing together complex sentences. Plus, he was a murderous zombie baby in the movie. What kind of people would we be if we didn't include him in this list?</p><h2 id=3-baby-harry---harry-potter-and-the-philosopher-s-stone><strong>3. Baby Harry - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</strong></h2><p>There was a rumor that got a lot of legs that the baby Harry from the flashbacks in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone was the same actor that played Harry's son, Albus, all those years later in The Deathly Hallows Part II. It would have been kind of awesome if it were true but it ain't. No, the baby Harry was originally played by a set of triplets, the Saunders triplets. After their brush with fame, the three kids retired and have been taking it easy. Even though they only got a snippet of screen time, the fact that they got to play one of the most iconic characters in film history has got to be something to hang your hat on.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-oscar---ghostbusters-2><strong>2. Oscar - Ghostbusters 2</strong></h2><p>Remember the awesome baby in Ghostbusters 2? It was <a href=#>Sigourney Weaver's</a> character's baby and Vigo the Carpathian, the creepy guy from the painting, wanted to take him? He floated around in his stroller. His name was Oscar and, like so many on this list, he was played by twins, William T. Deutschendorf and Hank J. Deutschendorf II. After absolutely crushing it in this film, the twins went on to crush their opponents in the world of Karate. They ended up starting a school of their own and now teach other kids how to crush their opponents. Looks like a little bit of Vigo the Carpathian wore off on these little guys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-toby-labyrinth><strong>1. Toby – Labyrinth</strong></h2><p>You probably haven’t heard of the name Toby Froud, but he's the actor who played the baby Toby in the cult classic Labyrinth. You know, the baby in the striped onesie who was kidnapped by Jareth the Goblin King (<a href=#>David Bowie</a>). Toby sat there and watched as Bowie danced around in the skin-tightest pants that ever pantsed. Toby's real-life papa was the conceptual designer and costume designer on the film, making it all the more beautiful that Toby became a puppeteer and designer in films himself, working on The Chronicles of Narnia, BoxTrolls, ParaNorman and Kubo and the Two Strings. Here we see how a person's very first job would shape the rest of his life.</p><p>Sources: Wikipedia; IMDB; Huffington Post; Daily Mail</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWZqbV2ivLe1xGaYp5xdqcNursCboJ6rXZa7pXnWoZitZaSdsrp5y6impGWcnrimedOom5qxXw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./aramis-ramirez-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Aramis Ramirez Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./12-of-the-least-explored-frontiers-on-earth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>12 Of The Least Explored Frontiers On Earth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
