(As seen on season 6, the couple abruptly moved from a 10,000 square-foot penthouse rental to a 4,000 square foot apartment costing $45,000 a month.)</p><p>“If it’s a rental, then obviously the home isn’t going to be split or stolen or anything like that,” Rahmani surmised. “[If] they’re both on the lease then they’re both on the lease regardless of whether they’re married or not.”</p><p>He noted that the estranged couple will both be “on the hook” in terms of the rental lease.</p><p>“When it comes to the other assets, cars, bank accounts, you [have] to do that accounting to see [who gets what],” Rahmani said. “It’s really called tracing.”</p><p>The attorney explained that a family law judge will have to determine, “What is the source of the funds? Is it my separate property that’s going through an account, in which the money comes to me <a href=#>in the event of a divorce</a>? Is it my separate property but I just commingle it? Or is that gifted to a spouse such that it ends up being shared?”</p><p>Beauty salon owner Alexia and real estate broker Todd tied the knot in 2021 after several years of dating. Us confirmed on Thursday, April 11, that Todd filed for divorce in the state of Florida. He alleged in court documents that the marriage was “irretrievably broken.”</p><p>While Todd has remained silent about the split, <a href=#>Alexia broke her silence</a> on Monday, April 15.</p><p>“I am shocked and heartbroken that Todd has chosen to dissolve our marriage,” Alexia wrote via her Instagram Stories. “I will take comfort in the fact that my friends and family will be by my side supporting me during this difficult time.”</p><p>Us later confirmed that the pair <a href=#>entered into a prenuptial agreement</a> on December 10, 2021, days before <a href=#>their rescheduled wedding in St. Barth’s</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>According to court documents obtained by Us on Tuesday, April 16, the agreement helped Alexia and Todd address “all of their financial issues.”</p><p>Ahead of her relationship with Todd, <a href=#>Alexia was married to <strong>Peter Rosselo Sr</strong>.</a> from 1992 to 1996. The exes share sons Peter, 31, and Frankie, 26. Alexia moved on with <strong>Herman Echevarria</strong> in 2004. They parted ways in 2015, one year before Echevarria died.</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahp6div6m7zKxkmqSVrbaiec2ep6ikkWK1tr%2FBmqWdq12WwLSx06xksKGcoXqjsYydoK%2BhlJqxbrXNZpuirp%2BnsKZ7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./joe-montana-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Joe Montana Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-what-happened-to-gisele-b%C3%BCndchen-s-net-worth-after-tom-brady.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What Happened To Gisele Bndchen's Net Worth After Tom Brady</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
