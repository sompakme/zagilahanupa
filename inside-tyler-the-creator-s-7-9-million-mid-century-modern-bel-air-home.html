In his early 30s, the rapper has established a successful music career and became one of the most popular artists of his generation. His jazz, hip-hop, and rap combination has made him a unique talent. After releasing two <a href=#>Billboard No.1 albums</a> and winning Grammy awards for his eccentric music, he has amassed a $16 million fortune. Tyler, The Creator, likes to spend his net worth buying expensive jewelry and <a href=#>investing in real estate</a>. His recent purchase is a stunning home rich in history yet contemporary.</p><p>A $7.9 million property boasts every luxury amenity required by the rapper, his Bel-Air home is a majestic place that offers privacy and an old-fashioned charm.</p><h2 id=a-home-for-generations>A Home For Generations</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While Tyler, The Creator, is not a fan of traditional things, he has managed to bag a spacious home that is mid-century yet contemporary on the inside. Located in a less popular cul-de-sac in the upper end of Bel-Air in California, the home is located on the hills above Sunset Boulevard. The single-story home was first constructed in 1965 and has been through several renovations over the last few decades. The home has been reconstructed and expanded multiple times and now boasts a 6,000 sq. ft. of living space, as stated by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>. The addition of space has given the house a tail-like curve compared to the original modest structure of the home.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Inside Simon Cowell And Lauren Silverman's $10 Million Love Nest</a></span></p><p>The property is recluse from the glamour and glitz of <a href=#>Hollywood homes</a> and is surrounded by large gates that hide the home from public sight and stretch for miles. The home is not visible from the street and comes with a large walkway that leads to the all-glass entry that is the beginning of the contemporary décor in the mid-century home. The entrance foyer boasts a gallery-like interior with sculptures, mural, and hanging artifacts. The abode is fixed with travertine flooring, which can be seen in every room.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luxurious-inside-and-out>Luxurious Inside And Out</h2><p>Past the foyer, the home welcomes guests into a great central room with a minimalist and stunning interior. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Men</a>, the room has glass walls that allow the space to drench in natural sunlight and offer an entry to the grassy backyard. Additionally, an electric fireplace can warm the room on cold nights. The formal dining room shimmers with a crystal chandelier and white and beige chairs that match the house's theme. The centerpiece of the kitchen is an expansive kitchen island made from travertine, inspired by the decor in the 90s. The fully-functional kitchen is equipped with SubZero and stainless steel Wolf appliances.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Bel Air home has four bedrooms and five bathrooms, each decorated for cozy yet elegant living. The contemporary Master Suite is equipped with a queen-size bed, television, and an electric fireplace. It has an ensuite Master Bathroom decorated with Calcutta marble and offers views of the garden through the glass walls. Adjoining the bedroom is a dual closet and a massive office. The home office is one of the house's unique features as it has two workstations with built-in desks and shelves, as reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>.</p><h2 id=spacious-abode-for-parties>Spacious Abode For Parties</h2><p><a href=#>While the other bedrooms and bathrooms</a> are comparatively smaller than the Master Suite, they still offer expansive space for comfortable accommodation. Other notable rooms include a media room that features an L-shaped couch positioned with a large screen for movie nights. It is also functional as a home library as it features built-in bookshelves. As mentioned by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Homes News</a>, one of the rooms in the mansion is a luxurious spa. The home also has a functional gym with speakers and a mirrored wall. The room has direct access to the backyard.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As the home went through multiple renovations, the living space increased in size, while limited space was left for the outdoor patio. Nonetheless, the home features every outdoor amenity found in a luxury home. The patio has an outdoor built-in barbecue station that works as a kitchen next to the alfresco dining area. The eye-catching feature of the outdoors is the infinity-edge swimming pool that overlooks the distant hills and surrounding pine trees. The outlook is completed with a dramatic fireplace that enhances the visual during the night.</p><p>An exquisite house in every sense, Tyler, The Creator, has purchased a stunning property that is a contemporary masterpiece in architecture. A home that has stood the test of many renovations over the years, it has the beauty to change with every real estate trend in the market. The Bel-Air mansion is the ideal home for the artist to take a break from making music or host a party for friends.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>MrBeast Tops List Of Highest-Earning YouTubers For The First Time</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dirt</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elite Men</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Yahoo News</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luxury Homes News</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaipqOesaZ507KjnqpdqbWmecKrnJqsn6fAboOMcmSmoZyhtrC6jKagnWWTmru1wdGyZKanlJq%2Fr3nBnqNmmZmneqm7zJ5m</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jonathan-majors-appears-in-court-with-meagan-good-gets-trial-date.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jonathan Majors Appears In Court With Meagan Good, Gets Trial Date</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-incredible-comebacks-following-horrible-sports-injuries.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Incredible Comebacks Following Horrible Sports Injuries</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
