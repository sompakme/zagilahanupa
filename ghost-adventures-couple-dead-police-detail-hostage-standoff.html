William Rulla</strong> told the paper that the incident began at 6:30 a.m., when police got a call from a woman who had found the body of her male roommate (whose name has not been disclosed) dead inside their home. As police investigated the death, they discovered that another one of the caller's roommates, Debby Constantino, was missing.</p><p>Using a cellphone tracking device, police were able to find Debby inside her daughter's apartment with her estranged spouse, Mark, who had kidnapped her.</p><p>Reno Police Department Deputy Chief <strong>Tom Robinson</strong> told the Gazette Journal that once police arrived on the scene and knocked on the apartment's door, they heard the sound of several shots being fired. According to KTVN, shots were fired at the officers through the door.</p><p>The suspect then told police to "give me 15 minutes to gather my thoughts or I'll kill her," reported the Gazette Journal.</p><p>Police tried negotiating with the suspect, and were later joined by local FBI agents who tried to get Mark to surrender. After hours of futile negotiation, the SWAT team forced entry into the apartment, using explosives to blast the front door open. Inside, the Travel Channel stars were both found dead.</p><p>Police did not reveal the manner in which they were killed.</p><p>During the entire standoff, the local Sparks High School, located near the apartment, was placed on lockdown. The precaution was lifted at 2:35 p.m. local time.</p><p>This wasn't the couple's first domestic violence incident. Last month, Mark was charged with kidnapping and domestic battery against his estranged wife. She had obtained a restraining order against him. Their adult daughter — who owned the apartment in which the couple died — was also charged as an accomplice in that particular incident.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Watch footage from their Travel Channel show above.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGagoJ%2BowW6tw6%2Bcp6ylp7K0ecKorKmklWKxpq3DZqeopJmYsm6wxK2YoqRdnby0wMCgnGarpJa7pbvFn2RraGFqf3WFjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-what-the-cast-of-the-butterfly-effect-is-up-to-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Here's What The Cast Of 'The Butterfly Effect' Is Up To Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./donna-kelce-gifted-taylor-swift-her-87-jersey-ring-says-designer.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Donna Kelce Gifted Taylor Swift Her 87 Jersey Ring, Says Designer</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
