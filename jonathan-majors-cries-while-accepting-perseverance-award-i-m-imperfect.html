When they snatched me up out of my apartment in handcuffs, I didn’t feel like all that,” the thespian expressed. “I didn’t feel like Jonathan Majors, Mr.&nbsp;Creed, Mr. Kang; I felt like a little scared, weak boy, despite the support and evidence that was in my favor, I knew sh*t was bad. And it was bad because of who I was and what I am. This is what happens to Black people all too often.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">He then spoke about the concept of the Perseverance Award, an accolade given to those who inspire in the face of obstacles. Majors explains that society often puts Black men in two different extremes, entirely good or entirely evil, with no nuance for the space in-between.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=# rel=nofollow>#Kang</a> actor Jonathan Majors breaks into tears as he accepts the Perseverance Award at Hollywood Unlocked Impact Awards.</p><p>In his 17-minute speech, he details his arrest, the conviction, and the Hollywood stars who supported him.</p><p>(via <a href=# rel=nofollow>@chrissgardner</a>) <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/LIdzk4Tk7h</a></p>— Cosmic Marvel (@cosmic_marvel) <a href=# rel=nofollow>June 22, 2024</a></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The God I serve has put me in a position where I’ve had to embody [perserverance] more than I wished or wanted to.

In an interview with <a href=#>Deadline,</a> Martin detailed the upcoming film, stating, “Merciless&nbsp;intertwines themes of possession, revenge, and personal justice within a haunting narrative. It explores the psychological descent of John, played by Majors, and the supernatural forces challenging his sanity.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Merciless&nbsp;will be developed by producer Christopher Tuffin, who plans to use the movie as the inaugural project under his new global media venture. Tuffin stated to&nbsp;Deadline&nbsp;that the brand’s identity and name would be unveiled at the Toronto Film Festival and spoke about working with Majors, saying, “I consider it an honor and a privilege to be working with Jonathan, who is such a great talent now that this matter has been adjudicated.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5%2B8r63ToZinZZ2Wt7C%2B0maaq6GVqHqxsdGsnK%2Bdopa7pLGMmq6aqpRifnN%2Fk3FvcWthbHw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./minkah-fitzpatrick-net-worth-how-much-is-minkah-fitzpatrick-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Minkah Fitzpatrick Net Worth How Much is Minkah Fitzpatrick Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./is-cindy-gambino-dead-death-cause-where-is-her-killer-husband-robert-farquharson-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Is Cindy Gambino Dead?
