At least, not that we know of. The reality is, Trisha is Garth's second wife, and he has a relatively low-profile yet super-expensive divorce under his belt already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>At least, it's low-profile in terms of celeb breakups&nbsp;these&nbsp;days.&nbsp;In 1986, Garth (whose full name is Troyal Garth Brooks) married Sandy Mahl, and they had three daughters together between 1992 and 1996.</p><p>The couple really lived through Garth's biggest years of fame together, notes&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Country Fan Cast</a>, but in 1999, they separated. Ironically, that was&nbsp;around the same time that Garth officially retired from touring (at least, for that round of his country music fame) to spend more time with his family.</p><p>He indicated that he wanted to grow closer to his children, and said he'd return to recording and performing after his youngest child was finished with school.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Garth Brooks Facts That Country Music Fans Wish Were Swept Under The Rug</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It doesn't sound like the divorce was too acrimonious, though; Garth said at the time, "Sandy and I both agree that we need to get divorced," confirmed&nbsp;Country Fan Cast. He then elaborated, "Right now, we’re focused on the impact it will have on the children and how to handle that best, to remain parents even if we don’t remain husband and wife."</p><p>Still, Garth had to pay out a rumored $125 million to Sandy Mahl Brooks, say multiple sources,</p><p>Then, in 2005, Garth married Trisha Yearwood, and the rest is history. The pair settled down in Oklahoma to be near Garth's daughters; <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">like many other country stars, he mostly lived out of the spotlight</a>.</p><p>In 2019, Garth indulged fans' questions in an A&E special that chronicled his life. As&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Good Housekeeping</a> reported, Garth admitted that during his rise to fame, he traveled often and wasn't home with Sandy very much. And yet, he hadn't realized how much they'd grown apart until Sandy talked about her feelings on the matter for the documentary.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>But in that same documentary, Garth admitted that he'd met Trisha the same year he married Sandy, and he "felt that feeling like when you just meet your wife." Maybe that's part of the reason he felt he owed Sandy the $125 mil when they divorced? Though, Garth and Trisha weren't quite on the same level as, say, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LeAnn Rimes and Eddie Cibrian</a>.</p><p>In both the A&E special and when receiving one of his earliest awards for country music, Garth thanked his former wife for everything she'd done to support his career. As&nbsp;Country Music Thang quoted, Sandy was a driving force in Garth's success. And because he rose to fame during the time they were married, she was entitled to a large portion of his net worth.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now, however, he's worth around $350 million (even without Trisha's wealth), so he's not doing too poorly for himself.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Little-Known Facts About Garth Brooks' Ex, Sandy Mahl</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiemqqknXqjvs6ooqxllJ7DsL7CnmSsnaSpuaa5xKeraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-sued-for-10-million-after-sampling-lyrics-without-permission.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Drake Sued For $10 Million After Sampling Lyrics Without Permission</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./best-under-eye-cream-for-wrinkles-aging-and-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Best Under-Eye Cream for Wrinkles, Aging And More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
