The movie’s plot is confusing, and however, it emphasizes the destruction caused when manipulated objects used as weapons fall into the wrong hands. A CIA agent named the Protagonist must save the world as few things unfold in the future. The film boasts an incredible cast, including John David Washington, Elizabeth Debicki, and Robert Pattinson, and <a href=#>the Warner Bros studios produced</a> the movie.</p><p>A film with a gigantic budget, <i>Tenet, </i>has a classic Nolan edge. The plot's standard characteristics, such as time-bending, out-of-order chronology, and crime drama<b>, </b>keep the audience awe-struck.</p><h2 id=an-overview-of-the-plot>An Overview Of The Plot</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>John plays the role of an unnamed CIA agent known as The Protagonist who participated in an undercover operation at a Kyiv Opera House. He, employed by an organization named Tenet, whose mission is to ensure the human race's survival. As on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Movie Culture</a>, a masked soldier with a distinctive trinket helps him. The soldier appears to fire a bullet through a hostile gunman.

John David Washington, who played the main character in the movie, admitted that he always had questions for Christopher while shooting the film. <a href=#>Robert Pattinson</a>, too, had a hard time understanding the plot, which left him disoriented. Even after spending months reading through his lines and working on the set, he could not determine what was going on in the film reported by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>. Dimple Kapadia, an Indian actress who played the role of a spy agent in the movie, also reported that she would have to watch the film at least three more times before she could understand anything.</p><h2 id=the-budget-and-box-office-numbers>The Budget And Box Office Numbers</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenrant</a> reports that the production budget of <i>Tenet</i> is around $200-225 million. It is one of the most expensive films in Nolan's career<b>.</b> The budget on <i>Tenet </i>is higher than that of Christopher’s previous films like The Dark Knight($185 million), Inception($160 million), and Interstellar($165 million). It is more like The Dark Knight Rises, which had a budget of around $250 million. Going by the general rule, Tenet would have to make at least $400 million to recoup the cost of production.</p><p>Reports suggest that the film needs to earn $800 million to profit. The film was originally scheduled to premiere in July but got delayed due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. As Nolan’s movie is finally released, it is one of the first major films to come out in theaters since multiplexes reopened after months. International box-office relies on the film to be a much-needed boost for business after being walloped during the crisis. So far, it has made $362.92 million in the worldwide box office and $50 million in domestic video sales.</p><h2 id=current-net-worth-of-the-cast>Current Net Worth Of The Cast&nbsp;</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Observer</a> says that Christopher Nolan stands to make a ton of money if <i>Tenet</i> breaks out as the blockbuster Warner Bros hopes it can be. Nolan is expected to receive 20 percent of movie's gross. This means that Nolan will get a percentage of the box office revenue beginning with the film's release rather than when the movie returns a profit. Nolan has made such deals with WB, but it is still a privilege reserved for a few filmmakers.</p><p>The net worth of different actors and crew is a factor in determining the cost of production. <a href=#>Christopher Nolan has a net worth of $180 million</a>. At present, the lead actors John David Washington, Pattinson, and Elizabeth boast a net worth of $8 million, $100 million, $1.9 million, respectively. The supporting cast includes Dimple Kapadia, Michael Caine, and Kenneth Branagh, who have a net worth of $10 million, $80 million, and $60 million, respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, Tenet is a big-budget movie by Christopher Nolan with Warner Bros Production. It is one of Nolan's most expensive films and expects to make at least $400 million at the box office. Nolan stands to gain a massive amount of money if the film becomes a blockbuster, as WB hopes it would be.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>The Cast Of Selling Sunset, Ranked By Net Worth</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Observer</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Screenrant</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cheat Sheet</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Movie Culture</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSubrjOqKJmmaRiwamxjLCmq6SUrLalsYycpqWklZjBqrvNZqafZaSau6bAjJqlnWWknbJuusStZLCnoqm1brvFZqCtq12YrrTAjg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./cozy-little-house-blogs-top-cozy-little-house-blogs-and-websites.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Cozy Little House Blogs Top Cozy Little House Blogs and Websites</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-between-florence-pugh-and-shia-labeouf.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened Between Florence Pugh And Shia LaBeouf?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
