A successful movie usually leads to talks of a sequel, but the truth is that these movies almost never live up to its predecessor. Franchises like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">MCU</a>,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Star Wars</a>, and the&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fast & Furious</a> have done well here, but they are a rare breed.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Back in 2003,&nbsp;Elf was released into theaters and instantly became a loved film that blossomed into a holiday classic. Over the years, there have been vocal fans that want nothing more than to see the cast back in action, but we haven’t seen anything materialize.</p><p>Let’s take a look and see why there hasn’t been a sequel to&nbsp;Elf.</p><h2 id=elf-was-a-massive-hit>Elf Was A Massive Hit</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/C94FE0B9-779B-4170-BAEA-550C89DE3A14.jpeg><p>Elf may be a timeless classic now, but back when it was released, it was not a guarantee to become a hit. After all, holiday films come out each and every year, and for the most part, they are quickly forgotten about and tossed alongside all the other ones that had been released in year’s past.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For&nbsp;Elf, utilizing a sharp cast with Will Ferrell, Zooey Deschanel, and James Caan was instrumental in it getting over with fans. Furthermore, Jon Favreau, who has turned into one of the best directors in Hollywood, was a perfect fit to bring it all together and help get it onto the big screen. All the ingredients were there for a hit, and once&nbsp;Elf hit theaters, it did quite well for itself.</p><p>According to&nbsp;Box Office Mojo, the film was able to gross $220 million at the worldwide box office. This was a nice hit for the studio and for all involved, but they had no idea that the film would remain popular as time went on. In fact, it is now one of the most popular holiday flicks ever made.</p><p>Now, we have seen holiday movies like&nbsp;A Christmas Story keep things simple with just one film, but people still wanted to see more of Buddy the Elf and the friends that he made in the film. Turns out, there may be a few reasons why it never happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Christmas Classic ‘Elf’ Was Almost A Very Different (And Darker) Movie</a></span></p><h2 id=there-was-tension-between-will-ferrell-and-jon-favreau>There Was Tension Between Will Ferrell And Jon Favreau</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/3C886065-8C5A-4AAB-9D4A-6248A71C4A34.jpeg><p>James Caan, one of the stars of the film, actually opened up about the potential of a sequel and why it never came to pass.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Caan</a>, “We were gonna do it, and I thought ‘Oh my God, I finally have a franchise movie. I can make some money, let my kids do what the hell they want to do.’ The director and Will didn’t get along very well. Will wanted to do it, and he didn’t want the director. He had it in his contract. It was one of those things.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That’s right, things were not always so great between the film’s star and its director, which is never an easy thing to deal with. While they were still able to get through filming, it is clear that this was a dividing factor in the sequel ever getting off of the ground.</p><p>It may seem easy to just slide in another director, but the truth is that tampering with one of the reasons why the first film was so successful could have a negative impact on the sequel. Obviously, Ferrell would have to be around, meaning that Favreau would be the odd man out. Who’s to say that it would work out with someone else?</p><p>Despite the pair not getting along, they still made movie magic. Interestingly, Ferrell has actually been offered a chance to make an&nbsp;Elf sequel.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Will Ferrel, Jon Favreu, Ed Helms, And Others Join ‘Elf For Georgia’ Table Read To Benefit Georgia Democrats</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ferrell-has-turned-it-down-before>Ferrell Has Turned It Down Before</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/59CFF9FD-D7AC-47DD-9D50-1E83430C8ACC.jpeg><p>Movie studios like making money, and making a sequel to&nbsp;Elf seems like a simple decision to make. This is precisely why Ferrell has been offered the chance to hop back in the saddle as Buddy. In fact, he was offered $29 million to do it.</p><p>Ferrell would tell&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>, “I remember asking myself: could I withstand the criticism when it's bad and they say, 'He did the sequel for the money?' I decided I wouldn't be able to. I didn't want to wander into an area that could erase all the good work I've done—but you watch, I'll do some sequel in the future that's crap.”</p><p>Ferrell does have a point. People are always quick to criticize, and had the sequel not lived up to the original, there would have been a ton of backlash.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Happiest Season & 9 Other Christmas Movies To Watch With Your Significant Other</a></span></p><p>Whether it is from tension or from wanting to preserve the legacy of the first film, it doesn’t seem like an&nbsp;Elf&nbsp;sequel is going to ever happen.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Top 10 Christmas Movies Of The 2000s, Ranked According to IMDb</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ1dp7KiuIyrnJqrn6N6uLTYZpylnl1neq%2Bx1Z6pZqCRpb2musSdZg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tito-ortiz-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tito Ortiz Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./nerdwax-shark-tank-founder-net-worth-and-investment.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Nerdwax Shark Tank Founder, Net Worth and Investment</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
