It was in their final season, so there was even more attention on that final season. Almost all my scenes were with Cynthia Nixon — who just could not have been more warm, welcoming and hospitable.”</p><p>Sex and the City, which premiered in 1998, focused on Carrie (<strong>Sarah Jessica Parker</strong>) and her dating life in New York alongside her friends Charlotte (<strong>Kristin Davis</strong>), Miranda Hobbes (Nixon) and Samantha (<strong>Kim Cattrall</strong>). After six seasons on HBO and two movies, <a href=#>the hit series was revived as And Just Like That </a>for Max in December 2021.</p><p>Underwood left a memorable impression on fans as a sports medicine doctor for the New York Knicks who dated Miranda <a href=#>before she ultimately ended up with Steve</a> (<strong>David Eigenberg</strong>). Miranda and Steve, who already shared son Brady, got married and were together until the first season of AJLT when she wanted a divorce so she <a href=#>could pursue her romance with Che Diaz (<strong>Sara Ramírez</strong>).</a></p><p>By season 2 of AJLT, <a href=#>Miranda and Che’s romance started to fizzle</a> and it has since been confirmed that Ramírez, 48, is not reprising their character. This leaves the door open for Dr. Robert to <a href=#>woo his way back into Miranda’s life</a> — and Underwood isn’t the only one who thinks so.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1-Blair-Underwood-Is-Definitely-Open-to-Appearing-on-AJLT-Now-That-Miranda-Is-Single-Again-Shares-Where-He-Thinks-Dr-Robert-Is-Now.jpg><p>Nixon, 58, was previously asked who she <a href=#>would like to see return to the SATC franchise</a>, telling Grazia in April 2023, “Blair Underwood. I have to say, I wonder what’s become of him. Did he get married? Did he have children? Is he still the doctor for the Knicks? What’s happening with him? I would like to see that.”</p><p>Luckily Underwood has some <a href=#>insight into where he thinks Dr. Robert is</a> now. He told Us that he could see his character still being a doctor for the Knicks but he wouldn’t mind if Robert was “retired” and “having a good time” while traveling the world.</p><p>Underwood’s potential appearance on AJLT might have to wait though as the actor <a href=#>is in his horror era with a role in the summer’s scariest</a> movie: Longlegs.</p><p>“What [director] Osgood [Perkins], I think brilliantly, was he kind of took shades and textures of different films. We know Silence of the Lambs and many other ones, but he really, in addition to that, created his own special thing,” Underwood explained. “People don’t really know where it’s going, and it’s a surprise.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/3-Blair-Underwood-Is-Definitely-Open-to-Appearing-on-AJLT-Now-That-Miranda-Is-Single-Again-Shares-Where-He-Thinks-Dr-Robert-Is-Now.jpg><p>Underwood <a href=#>is excited to explore more horror projects</a> after being a long time fan of the genre, adding, “The reason I’m a horror fan is because I love the thrill-seeking of it all. Just like roller-coasters. And it’s almost like, ‘I dare you, can you scare me?’”</p><p><a href=#>In addition to Longlegs</a>, Underwood also filmed the upcoming Starz series Three Women, which viewers can check out in the fall.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“That one was more difficult to get into because a lot of it is very risqué. It’s very sexual. It’s a great story,” he told Us. “It’s three different women finding themselves in this next chapter of their lives.”</p><p>Longlegs is in theaters now</p><p>With reporting by Christina Garibaldi</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmlmZmnera6w56psKefmXqqv4yipa2doprAtbHDZqCnZZGfubV5wKmnnpmilruksYysoKeblWK6qr7Ap5uaZZmoerS1zaCjnmc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-is-actress-amanda-seyfried-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Is Actress Amanda Seyfried Worth?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ben-thompson-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ben Thompson Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
