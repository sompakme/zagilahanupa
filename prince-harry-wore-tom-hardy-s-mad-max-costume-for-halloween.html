The costume party was one of the last times the couple were <a href=#>able to go out under wraps</a> before their relationship was made public.</p><p>“I flew to Toronto. End of October 2016,” Harry wrote. “Meg was excited to show me her life, her dogs — her little house, which she adored. And I was eager to see it all, to know every last detail about her.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Prince-Harry-Borrowed-Tom-Hardys-Mad-Max-Costume-for-1st-Halloween-Party-With-Meghan-Markle-993.jpg><p>Harry noted that it was <a href=#>his “first proper visit” to Canada</a>, though he’d briefly “snuck into” the country in the past. The duo were able to “maintain the bubble” of <a href=#>their then-secret romance</a> as they prepared for an “Apocalypse”-themed party at Soho House in Toronto.</p><p>“I mumbled to Meg that I’d not had great luck with themed fancy-dress parties, but I’d give it another go,” the Invictus Games founder continued, <a href=#>seemingly referencing the Nazi officer getup</a> that landed him in hot water in 2005. “For help with my costume, I’d turned to a friend, the actor Tom Hardy, before I left home.”</p><p>The former military pilot called Hardy, now 45, to ask if he’d be able to borrow the costume he wore in 2015’s Mad Max: Fury Road. “‘The whole thing?'” Hardy replied, per Harry’s recollection. “‘Yes, please, mate! The whole kit.'”</p><p>According to the prince, Meghan, now 41, “roared with laughter” when she saw him in the outfit. “It was funny. And a little scary,” Harry wrote. “But the main thing was: I was unrecognizable.”</p><p>The Suits alum donned a pair of ripped black shorts, fishnet tights and a camouflage top. “If that’s the Apocalypse, I thought, bring on the end of the world,” her husband teased.</p><p>The twosome were accompanied by <a href=#><strong>Princess Eugenie</strong></a> and her now-husband, <a href=#><strong>Jack Brooksbank</strong></a>, to the 2016 bash. Harry and Meghan previously <a href=#>shared a never-before-seen glimpse of their Halloween costumes</a> during their six-part Netflix series in December 2022.</p><p>“[Harry] borrowed a great costume,” the Bench author said in <a href=#>episode 1 of Harry & Meghan</a>. “And we were like, ‘Well, this might be our last shot to just go out and have fun in the world.’ … It was so great, just silly fun and then [snap].”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Sussexes <a href=#>had been secretly dating</a> since July 2016, but news of their romance made headlines not long after they celebrated Halloween that year. “H tried to prepare me for what that might be like, knowing what he’d experienced in the past,” Meghan recalled in the docuseries as the pair discussed <a href=#>the heightened scrutiny they faced</a> from the British tabloids.</p><p>Nearly one year after the Canadian costume party, Harry proposed. He and Meghan tied the knot in May 2018, <a href=#>welcoming son Archie</a> the following spring. The Archewell cofounders expanded their family with <a href=#>daughter Lilibet</a> in June 2021 after moving to California in the wake of <a href=#>their 2020 step down</a> from their senior royal roles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX6W%2FqrrCnmShmaKnxm7DzqucZqyfonqprdGdsKxlnZaxbrnAsWScp6Opwq6xjJ%2Bmq2WYlrmtu9aenKdn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./sasha-banks-wiki-height-weight-age-boyfriend-family-biography-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Sasha Banks Wiki, Height, Weight, Age, Boyfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./megan-hilty-breaks-silence-after-family-dies-in-plane-crash.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Megan Hilty Breaks Silence After Family Dies in Plane Crash</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
