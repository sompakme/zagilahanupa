T.I. called Iggy a blunder, she in turn called him a misogynist, and a heated war of words ensued between the duo.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Snoop Dogg Still Feuding With Iggy Azalea?</a></span></p><p>Iggy's rise to the top raised several questions. The polarizing rapper wasn't well received by the public. From accusations of her using ghostwriters to her "made-up" accent, she became the butt of internet jokes. <a href=#>She's also been accused of blackfishing</a>, yet another reason why critics drag her all over social media.</p><p>Through it all, T.I. supported and defended her on various occasions… until he didn't. When the pair parted ways, social media weighed in and anticipated the end of Iggy's career. This was owing to the fact that many people attributed her success to T.I.'s input.</p><h2 id=t-i-helped-iggy-get-her-big-break>T.I. Helped Iggy Get Her Big Break</h2><p>When Iggy Azalea burst onto the scene, she was signed to T.I.'s Grand Hustle label. The two also collaborated on some music. She was a newcomer with catchy beats and an interesting aesthetic (though <a href=#>her appearance has changed even more over the years</a>). In 2014, Iggy won a VMA for favorite rap/hip-hop album and best rap artist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite making those strides, some fans couldn't get over her persona. She was accused of faking her accent and attempting to sound a certain way to appeal to hip-hop fans.</p><p>T.I. wasn't having any of that, he stood by his artist. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">He told Hard Knock TV</a>, "She has a vision for herself, that she will not compromise, she has a certain idea of how she wants to present herself and how to platform her art. I think she should be judged based on that rather than her cred, her nationality, what country she is from … I think all of that, those are stereotypes."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He believed in her potential, "When you start trying to classify people in different categories, then you diminish the purpose of what we do. What we do is try to bring people together … I think she can go in a lot of different genres because she’s cross-pollinated."</p><h2 id=iggy-and-tip-39-s-relationship-soured>Iggy And Tip's Relationship Soured</h2><p>Azalea was involved in a number of feuds with other celebrities. From Azealia Banks and Snoop Dogg to Eminem. Amidst the cultural appropriation allegations against Iggy, rap legend Q-Tip took to Twitter to give Iggy a hip-hop history lesson.</p><p>She didn't seem to appreciate that and responded in a manner that many deemed disrespectful.</p><p>Although T.I. defended his protégée against Q-Tip and anybody who dared to speak against her, he later changed his tune, and that marked the end of their partnership.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Iggy Azalea Quitting Music?

That is the tarnish of my legacy as far as [being] a [music] executive is concerned. To me, this is like when Michael Jordan went to play baseball."</p><p>In return, the Australian rapper fired off a series of now-deleted Tweets, where she called her former mentor a "misogynist" and asked him to move on. The former collaborators didn't hold back during their war of words.</p><h2 id=t-i-accused-azalea-of-switching-up>T.I. Accused Azalea Of Switching Up</h2><p>As if calling her a blunder wasn't enough, Tip later elaborated on his earlier sentiments about Iggy. Some fans had often spoken about how the Fancy rapper's persona would affect T.I.'s image and brand.</p><p>It seems he agreed with this assertion after parting ways with his protégée and had no problem speaking about it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Per T.I., Iggy Azalea started acting differently after earning her place in hip-hop and made decisions that impacted his reputation.</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">During an appearance on The breakfast club</a>, the rapper dished on why he parted ways with Iggy. He revealed, "I feel like she was meant to be great.
