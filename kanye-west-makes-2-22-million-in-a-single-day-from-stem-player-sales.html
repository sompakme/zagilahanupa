In the caption, he emphasized that he made more than $2.22 million in profits (8,000 devices) within the first 24 hours following his post about Donda 2’s exclusive release.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>$306 Million Class Action Lawsuit Launched Against Freedom Convoy</a></span></p><p>That’s more than 20% of the Stem Player’s sales since it debuted in August 2021, as the photo revealed the device has sold $9.49 million since its release last year,&nbsp;whereas the net sales since shipping totalled $4.69 million.</p><p>The Stem Player resembles an MP3 player in look and some functions, including giving users the ability to download a curation of music from its online platform. But it also allows&nbsp;users to customize their music by changing the tempo, isolating parts of the track, and adding special effects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Stem Player is selling for $200 USD on its website, with shipping that promises to take only a few days. Kanye said in a separate Instagram post that 67,000 units were ready to ship out but that 3,000 were being produced each day to keep up with what he anticipated to be a high demand.</p><p>Earlier this week, <a href=#>we reported that Kanye</a> – who legally changed his name to “Ye” recently – was boycotting all other streaming platforms other than his own for the releasee of his highly anticipated album, which is a follow-up (and shares the same name as) his 2021’s album Donda.</p><p>Kanye actually released the Stem Player in tandem with Donda last year, though the album was also available to stream on <a href=#>platforms like Spotify and Apple</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the post explaining Donda 2’s exclusive Stem release, the rapper expressed frustration with how little of the profits artists make when they team up with streaming platforms. “Today artists get just 12% of the money the industry makes,” he wrote, describing it as an “oppressive system” that he is vowing to “take control” of.</p><p>This isn’t the first time Kanye called out streaming platforms. Earlier this month, he claimed he turned down a $100 million deal with Apple put Donda on their streaming service.</p><p>Donda 2 is set to release on February 22nd.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Erika Jayne Facing $2.1 Million Lawsuit For 'Aiding & Abetting' Husband Tom Girardi</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=#>Instagram @kanyewest</a>, <a href=#>NME</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS4orrYnmSwnaOperTAxKZkqaSRrrKzedKao56rXWd6rrXLpaCopl2otq%2Bzy55knZmpZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./mike-chavez-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Mike Chavez Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./here-s-the-cast-of-the-office-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's The Cast Of The Office, Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
