For example, in February 2022, Kris was asked during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres show which of her kids she thinks is going to give her another grandchild.</p><p>In response, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kris said it would be “nice” to see Kendall</a> have the family’s next baby. “She’s the only one who hasn’t had a baby,” Kris said, adding she believes the model “would eventually love to have a baby.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kendall-jenner-says-she-wants-kids-but-not-right-now>Kendall Jenner Says She Wants Kids, But Not Right Now</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/kendall-jenner-flaunts-toned-stomach-after-being-asked-how-s-the-pregnancy-while-filming-1.jpg><p>Even though Kendall and Bad Bunny seem more serious than ever, Kris may still be waiting a while to see Kendall have children of her own, as the model has said she’s happy staying child-free for the time being.</p><p>In 2018, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Kendall said she planned to “wait a little while longer”</a> to have her own kids. The next year, she admitted to going through “phases” of wanting to settle down. “I think I have the fever,” she said, but added it’s not going to happen for a while at this point.</p><p>More recently, in a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">2023 interview with Entertainment Tonight</a>, Kendall says she plans to leave LA when the time comes for her to start having children.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"Oh, yeah. You heard it here first," she said. "I'm excited for that time in my life. I just know it’s not right now."</p><p>Kendall also addressed her desire to keep her relationship with Bad Bunny private, adding, "I try [to] find the balance of keeping things private and keeping things sacred, [and] also not letting the unfortunate frustration and stress of everyone trying to get in on it stop me from enjoying my side. Does that make sense?"</p><p>"I'll go out of my way to do things as privately as possible because I just think that that's the healthier way of dealing with relationships anyway,” Kendall continued.</p><p>Needless to say, it may be a while before fans get anymore updates on Kendall’s romantic life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiinqaUlrmtecmepaedomK6orfErGSrnZyWwaq7zayfoqhdrLa1tIybmJ1lkqq7r8WMoqWsrJGcv6K5jKidn6GTnq6tecCsZKSqmah6q7HNp5yrZaCqwKmx0mafnqpdqbxus8StZKaZoqe2prCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./top-entrepreneur-books-for-beginners-in-2024.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Top Entrepreneur Books for Beginners in 2024</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./daniella-karagach-pens-tribute-to-dwts-partner-jason-mraz.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Daniella Karagach Pens Tribute to DWTS Partner Jason Mraz</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
