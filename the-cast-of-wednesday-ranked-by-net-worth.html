The show which is based on The Addams Family focuses on the iconic character that is Wednesday Addams. The series dropped on <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>on November 23, and viewers have been hooked ever since with Wednesday setting and breaking its own record for hours watched in its first two weeks. It became the first English-language series to stream over 400 million hours in one week. As of writing, Wednesday sits at No. 2 in the U.S after it was dethroned by Netflix’s new thriller/drama series <a href=# rel=nofollow>The Recruit which stars Noah Centineo with Katharine King</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The series introduces us to some new faces and introduces some veterans to an entirely new demographic. Stars like Christina Ricci have been in Hollywood for decades; she played Wednesday Addams in the ‘90s Addams Family movies. Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzman who portray Morticia and Gomez Addams, have also been in the business for a while and have racked up quite impressive resumes. While the cast of Wednesday is new to many, they’d made a name for themselves before starring in the series.</p><p>We ranked the cast of Wednesday based on the net worth the actors have amassed over the years.
