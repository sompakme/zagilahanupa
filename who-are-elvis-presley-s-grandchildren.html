Unfortunately, Elvis' only grandson and lookalike, Benjamin Keough couldn't be there with them. He died by suicide in 2020. Here's everything you should know about the legend's grandchildren.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Elvis Presley's Ex-Linda Thompson Feels About Being 'Erased' From 'Elvis'</a></span></p><h2 id=what-is-riley-keough-famous-for>What Is Riley Keough Famous For?</h2><p>Riley is a star in her own right. She started out as a runway model and made her debut on a Dolce & Gabbana show. In 2010, she got her first acting job playing Marie Currie in The Runaways. She also appeared in Riverdale, Mad Max: Fury Road, and Magic Mike where she beat Lindsay Lohan for the role of Nora. The 33-year-old filmmaker is also known for her longtime friendship with Dakota Johnson — another third-generation actress. Dakota was a bridesmaid at Riley's wedding to stuntman Ben Smith-Petersen back in 2015. The couple reportedly dated for a year after meeting on the set of Mad Max: Fury Road. They tied the knot five months after their engagement.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Being born into a famous family, Elvis' eldest grandchild admitted that she was spoiled growing up. Though she never met her grandfather, she was pretty close to her stepfather, Michael Jackson. "I didn’t know Elvis, but I did know Michael," she told The Late Late Show with James Corden in 2017. "He'd get me lots of toys and things I wanted. One time he got me this really nice watch. We were at Disneyland. He bought me this really nice watch. It was a Beauty and the Beast watch — It was a really special one." She even brought one of Michael's chimpanzees to school one time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Extremely Complicated Truth About Elvis Presley's Daughter And Her Love Life</a></span></p><h2 id=what-really-happened-to-riley-keough-39-s-brother-benjamin-keough>What Really Happened To Riley Keough's Brother Benjamin Keough?</h2><p>In July 2020, Benjamin committed suicide. He was 27. According to his friend, Brandon Howard, Elvis' only grandson had depression prior to his death. "Sometimes he struggled with depression, which is a serious thing with [the coronavirus pandemic] and everything happening right now and everybody being locked in the house," Brandon told People. "It takes a lot. I wish I could have been there." He added that being a Presley certainly contributed to Benjamin's inner conflicts. "That kind of pressure is definitely a part of what happened," explained the singer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"It's a tough thing when you have a lot of pressure with your family and living up to a name and an image. It's a lot of pressure," he continued. "It's almost like you're pressured into having to be a musician, having to be an actor. It was good for him to go around the world and discover himself and have his own friends. You never know what triggers it. You never know ... It's so random."</p><p>Speaking to The New York Times a year later, Riley said that she felt "like I was thrown into the ocean and couldn't swim." The siblings, whose dad is Danny Keough, were very close. "The first four or five months, I couldn't get out of bed. I was totally debilitated. I couldn't talk for two weeks," the Zola star said of her grieving process. "It's very complicated for our minds to put that somewhere because it’s so outrageous. If I'm going through a breakup, I know what to do with that and where to file it in my mind, but suicide of your brother? Where do you put that? How does that integrate? It just doesn't."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Austin Butler Did This To Transform Into Elvis Presley</a></span></p><h2 id=how-old-are-harper-amp-finley-lockwood>How Old Are Harper & Finley Lockwood?</h2><p>Harper and Finley Lockwood are the youngest of the bunch. The 13-year-old twins are Lisa Marie's children with her fourth husband, guitarist Michael Lockwood. They were married from 2006 to 2016 until she filed for divorce. As of mid-2021, the two were in an ongoing custody battle over their daughters.</p><p>Though they have joint legal custody of the kids, People reported at the time that Michael only got three visits per week while his ex-wife had physical custody of them. It's unclear how the former couple resolved the matter. But these days, the girls regularly appear on Lisa Marie's Instagram page. "Like everyday, I couldn't have made it through without these three by my side," the singer said of the twins on her 53rd birthday post.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Real Way Austin Butler Perfected His Elvis Presley Voice</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoaddlr%2BmecSlraKrXaW%2Fpr%2FLnrCsZZenrq%2BwwqGgpZyimrtw</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./are-brandon-lowe-and-josh-lowe-related.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Are Brandon Lowe and Josh Lowe related?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ty-warner-net-worth-therichest.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ty Warner Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
