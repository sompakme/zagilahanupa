In fact, she is so popular that she is able to release <a href=#><strong>music</strong></a>, <a href=#>disappear for a few years</a>, and come back with her next album as if she'd never been away.</p><p>Adele has been able to amass such a massive net worth that she doesn't have to worry about working anymore. Yet what many will see as a ridiculous amount of money is just pennies to her.</p><h2 id=what-is-adele-39-s-net-worth>What Is Adele's Net Worth?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-49.jpg><p>Adele has had countless singles and awards and can afford to disappear for a few years after every album release.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2022, The Times put <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele on their rich list as reportedly being worth £150 million</a> (or $192.6 million).</p><p>However, since this number was released, she has done the last few months of her initial Las Vegas residency, and in June 2023, she embarked on an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">additional five months' worth of shows</a>. Due to this, that number has gone up quite a bit, and it is <strong>now reported that Adele's net worth is closer to $220 Million in 2023</strong>.</p><h2 id=how-has-adele-earned-her-money>How Has Adele Earned Her Money?</h2><p>Adele has really had to work hard in order to earn her money. She gets this from a number of different means, such as album and single releases, touring, and from her various TV appearances.</p><p>Some of this money will come from her album sales, with her most successful album arguably being '21', as it had <a href=#>spent an entire decade on the Billboard 200</a> by 2021. It was also the album that she earned the most money on overall.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adele Scoffed At Her Super Bowl Offer And Didn't Think Twice About Turning It Down</a></span></p><p><strong>She reportedly made $31 million in total album sales from '21'; as well as $34 million in total digital single sales.</strong> Both amounts combined barely even scratch the surface when it comes to her overall net worth of over $200 million.</p><p>More recently, there was her controversial Las Vegas residency, which left quite a few people out of pocket due to <a href=#>Adele's last-minute cancellation</a> of the original residency, after COVID affected quite a few aspects of the show, which made Adele feel like it wouldn't be to a high enough standard had it gone ahead as planned.</p><p>With tickets starting from $755 and going into the thousands, and a venue with 4200 seats, Adele is reportedly <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">set to earn over $2 million a night</a> for each of her shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-48.jpg><p>She also gets paid quite a lot of money for her TV interviews. For example, she received <a href=#>$1 million for an interview with Australian TV</a> host Matt Doran (even though she ended up walking out of the interview), and this included rights to show her One Night Only TV special.</p><p>Other ways Adele will have earned her net worth is by touring and other separate shows that she might have done along the way. These prices also will have varied over the years, especially as she has increased in popularity since her early days, but regardless of how much she charges, it all will have contributed to her overall net worth.</p><h2 id=where-does-adele-live>Where Does Adele Live?</h2><p>With a reported net worth of over $200 million in 2023, it's pretty safe to say that Adele will have more than a bit of small change every month to be able to spend on whatever she wants.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>An Australian TV Host Flew 10,000 Miles Only For Adele To Walk Out Of The Interview</a></span></p><p>One thing that Adele has recently <a href=#>splurged on is a $58 million mansion</a>, which used to belong to Sylvester Stallone. What makes this even more impressive, is that it was initially put on the market for double this amount, went down to $85 million in May, and then was agreed to sell to Adele for a much cheaper price tag.</p><p>After buying the property, Adele has been busy renovating it, which also will likely come with a hefty price point. How much she is spending on renovations isn't currently known, but with it coming with 3.5 acres of land, 12 bathrooms, and 8 bedrooms, it's not going to be cheap.</p><p>This is quite the contrast to the life she lived growing up. Adele lived in South London when she was growing up and due to a <a href=#>strained relationship with her dad</a>, the <a href=#>home she lived in was a much more modest flat</a> that was situated directly above a discount store, and she lived there with her mum and a flatmate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/untitled-design-47.jpg><p>There is also her <a href=#>divorce from her former husband Simon Konecki</a>. It's unknown how much this divorce has cost Adele, but given he was with her for the majority of her career so far, it's possible that he would have received some of the fortunes Adele had amassed by that point.</p><p>The pair also share a son together, and it's likely that Adele will be spending a fair amount of her net worth on him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Adele Will Not Tolerate Candid Pictures Of Her Son Angelo Adkins</a></span></p><p>Adele more recently went through her weight loss transformation and enlisted the help of <a href=#>personal trainer Pete Geramico</a>. He also happens to work at one of the most expensive gyms in London, so Adele's fees there could be high.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZ2imnqlu8SsZJqclaGybrjIr5xmppWperi70a2fZqWRo8Cqu81o</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-who-dated-joe-jonas-dated-before-he-married-sophie-turner.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebs Who Dated Joe Jonas Dated Before He Married Sophie Turner</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./theo-bertram-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Theo Bertram Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
