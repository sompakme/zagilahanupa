You want certain things for yourself, and falling in love and having a family and doing all those things felt important to us.”</strong></p><p>The Mayor who opened the doors for thousands of others to follow walked through the doors of City Hall the last time on May 12th as her term as Chicago’s Mayor came to an end.&nbsp;</p><p>City’s 56th mayor bid goodbye to her fifth-floor office at the City Hall after serving a four-year long term.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayor Lori’s mayoral term could be termed both historic and turbulent. Packed with groundbreaking measures, clickbait headlines, and unexpected setbacks, Lightfoot’s tenure will be remembered for a long time.&nbsp;</p><p>Chicago’s first Black female mayor received a momentous sendoff from her colleagues. She walked through the hallways surrounded by claps, happy cheers, and emotional glances.&nbsp;</p><p>Mayor Lori Lightfoot wife, Amy Eshleman, accompanied her on her farewell. She was seen greeting her wife’s colleagues with a big smile.&nbsp;</p><p>Referring to the wonderful send-off, Lightfoot said, <strong>“It’s been a glorious morning.”</strong></p><p>The former Mayor received her fair share of criticism and setbacks during her tenure, but she navigated through them with her head held high.&nbsp;</p><p>In her farewell address, Mayor Lori Lightfoot recalled her accomplishments, such as raising the city’s minimum wage and focusing federal COVID-19 relief dollars on the South and West sides.&nbsp;</p><p>She highlighted the importance of staying hopeful. She mentioned that hope directs one in the right direction and makes one resilient and motivated.&nbsp;</p><p>Moreover, she also offered the elected Mayor, Brandon Johnson, a word of advice. She told him to be the Mayor of the entire city and ensure his efforts were distributed equally amongst the citizens of Chicago.&nbsp;</p><p>Last but not least, she mentioned that even after formally retiring, her door will always remain open for the new Mayor, and she will be available for help whenever Johnson needs it.&nbsp;</p><p>After defying the odds all her life, the Mayor deserved an exit that would go down in history. Mayor Lori Lightfoot wife, Amy Eshleman, accompanied her at the time, and the two went off in style in a 1940 Cadillac.</p><p><strong>You may also read:</strong> <a href=#>Carl Edwards Wife, Katherine Downey: The Dynamic Force In His Life</a></p><p><strong>“Bye everybody!

Since then, the two have been each other’s pillars of strength and the building block of each other’s careers.</p><p>Amy hails from Sterling, Illinois, and she serves as a local community leader and philanthropist. As per sources, Amy received a degree in history from Miami University in 1984.&nbsp;</p><p>Even before meeting Lori, Amy was not a stranger to politics, as she worked in the US House of Representatives from 1984 to 1988.&nbsp;</p><p>After completing her designated time with Congress, Amy moved back to Chicago. There she worked as the Assistant Commissioner for the city’s public library for 20 years.&nbsp;</p><p>A few years after tying the knot, Lori and Amy adopted a baby girl named Vivian. She’s the pair’s only child and is often seeing accompanying her parents.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How did Lori and Amy meet?</h2><p>Lori and Amy first bumped into each other when the latter’s co-worker Mary Dempsey was tasked to work with Lori in then-Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley’s tenure.</p><p>Through Lori and Mary’s work with former mayor Daley, Lori eventually met Amy. After Lori was elected the 56th Mayor of Chicago on May 20, 2019, Amy became the First Lady of Chicago.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Amy and Lori met long before they got married, they kept their <a href=#>relationship</a> hidden until same-s*x marriages were legalized in Illinois.&nbsp;</p><p>Lori is the first openly lesbian African-American woman to assume a mayor’s office in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Lastly, to serve as the mayor of one of the country’s biggest cities must have had a fruitful monetary outcome.
