The “Wrecking Ball” singer took to Instagram on Monday, October 21, to share that she paid a visit to a tattoo parlor and added a new design to her ever-growing array of ink.</p><p>The 26-year-old posted an update via the photo-sharing app to joke about a “tat shop touch up,” as she shared a <a href=#>series of photos</a> of herself applying lipstick in a tattoo shop. The phrase, however, also had another meaning.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/Miley-Cyrus-vegemite-tattoo.jpg><p>In one of her Instagram Stories, the Hannah Montana alum showed off a new tattoo of a large rose on the back of her left upper arm. Not only does the latest addition to Cyrus’s body art collection have a connection to her <a href=#>ex</a> <a href=#><strong>Kaitlynn Carter</strong></a> (Carter had a <a href=#>small rose</a> tattooed on the back of her neck last month when she and Cyrus were still an item) but it also appears just above some older ink that Cyrus previously got as a tribute to another former paramour — <a href=#><strong>Liam Hemsworth</strong></a>.</p><p>The large floral number, which is surrounded by several dark leaves, is placed just above a much smaller jar of Vegemite. The popular Australian condiment was a favorite of Hemsworth’s, and the Grammy nominee was first spotted with a tattoo of it in 2016.</p><p>What’s more? The Hunger Games star, 29, has a matching Vegemite tattoo on his left leg, which he reportedly got around the same time as his now ex-wife.</p><p>This floral ink comes a week after the songstress <a href=#>debuted another tattoo</a> of a heart wrapped in banner that says “ROCK N ROLL HEART.” The organ, which is on Cyrus’s right upper arm, also has a dagger running straight through it. The star’s <a href=#>current boyfriend</a>, <a href=#><strong>Cody Simpson</strong></a>, got a similar design — a skull with crossbones and a knife stabbing it — on his chest.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former Disney star has been on a serious tattoo kick since her <a href=#>breakup with Hemsworth</a> in August. First, she debuted an <a href=#>intricate new snake tattoo</a> while in Italy in that same month with Carter, who she was dating at the time. Cyrus then revealed not one, but <a href=#>two new designs</a> during her performance at the 2019 MTV VMAs: her father’s birth year — 1961 — on her hand and song lyrics that read, “My head was feeling scared, but my heart was feeling free.”</p><p>Speaking of his <a href=#>relationship with Cyrus</a> earlier this month, Simpson told Us Weekly the pair “have a ball” with one another. “It hasn’t been a really crazy sudden thing is we’ve been friends for so long that when we sort of found each other again in a space where … We both met back in the day when we were partying a lot,” he continued. “We had a lot of fun then … but now we’ve found each other in a space where we’re not partying, working real hard and just like [to] keep things healthy.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmn6efmXyvsdasZqahnJrGbq%2FYq6ysZaOptq24jKGYrGWmmrSmucitnGaskanBsLuMmp2tnaJiuaqtzGafnqWjrLyzwMdmqqmkmal6sbTOraZo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./saints-derek-carr-and-heather-neel-s-relationship-timeline.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Saints Derek Carr and Heather Neels Relationship Timeline</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./cody-rhodes-goldust-comment-on-raw-goldust-promises-the-mcmahon-s-will-fall.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Cody Rhodes &amp;amp; Goldust Comment on Raw, Goldust Promises the McMahons Will Fall</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
