So much so that they championed, along with fans, to get him his first Emmy.</p><p>While <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">we wait for season 10</a>, let's look at what Peters' co-stars have to say about him.</p><h2 id=ahs-took-its-toll-but-ryan-murphy-wants-him-back>AHS Took Its Toll But Ryan Murphy Wants Him Back</h2><p>When each AHS season came out, the&nbsp;top thing fans wondered about the new season was what part Peters would have. This wasn't just because of his heartthrob status. It was mainly due to the fact that each of his characters on the show were literally scene stealers.</p><p>Speaking to GQ, Peters said that AHS actually took a lot out of him, and playing those creepy manic characters sometimes took too much.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">15 Surprising Facts About Evan Peters And Halsey’s Relationship</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I'm goofy, I'm silly, I like to have fun," he said. "I don't like to yell and scream. I actually hate it. I think it's disgusting and really awful, and it's been a challenge for me. Horror Story sort of demanded that of me.</p><p><strong>"</strong>It's just exhausting. It's really mentally draining, and you don't want to go to those places ever in your life. And so you have to go there for the scenes, and it ends up integrating it somehow into your life."</p><p>Despite the tolls it took, Peters' co-stars reportedly raved about his performance in Cult and rooted for him to get his first Emmy nomination (He went on to receive a&nbsp;Critics Choice Award in the 'Best Actor in a Movie Made for TV or Limited Series').</p><p>While&nbsp;playing Kai Anderson (Peters' favorite portrayal on the show) in the season, Peters' was offered more artistic license and was able to work with Ryan Murphy himself on Kai's story.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Episode eleven of Cult is one of Murphy's favorites because Peters works so well with Sarah Paulson.</a></p><p>"Largely this episode is my favorite because the pairing of Paulson vs Evan Peters was my favorite antagonist/protagonist thing we have ever done," Murphy told EW. "They are so close and really understand how to work with each other, and get underneath each other’s skin like brother and sister, so it really clicked.</p><p>"I really loved Evan’s performance so much, and so did Sarah. We still talk about it. Like once a week about how good he is? Evan is CRIMINALLY underrated in this role. He really suffered while making it, it took him I don’t know…two years to recover? Evan and I and Emma and Sarah and Holland Taylor had Thanksgiving together that year right after filming, and I remember Sarah and I kept feeding Evan food, trying to nourish him and make him feel better."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Why Wasn’t Emma Roberts Canceled After Her Altercation With Evan Peters?</a></span></p><p>"I really admired the dedication and the discipline he delivered."</p><p>Murphy said he talked to Peters about coming back to the show, but there's been no word on whether he will, but at least&nbsp;Murphy still works with the actor on Pose.</p><p>When they were still together during Cult, Roberts was also supportive of her boyfriend as he took on one of the hardest roles in his career.</p><h2 id=paulson-will-not-return-to-ahs-unless-peters-also-returns>Paulson Will Not Return To AHS Unless Peters Also Returns</h2><p>Paulson is the only other person to have starred in as much of AHS as Peters, and they've been through the wringer together. They even exited the show at the same time.</p><p>So with the bond that they have, it's cute to hear that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Paulson would only return to the show if Peters was doing it too.</a></p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">20 Photos Of Halsey That’ll Make Evan Peters Sweat</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Talking to TV Guide, Paulson said,&nbsp;"It's hard to not be a part of it.

She went on to explain that the one thing that would persuade her to return.</p><p><span class="NormalTextRun SCXW157517678 BCX0">"I would like to do something with Evan.

It's cool. I respect it."</p><p>So it seems that most of Peters' co-stars enjoy working with him because he's a dedicated actor and performs to the highest degree.&nbsp;Some won't even work on a project unless he's attached to it too.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's going to be really interesting to see how his career goes in the years to come if that means watching him reprise his AHS role or takes on even bigger things. Either way, we know he'll give an A+ performance, which hopefully&nbsp;won't mess with his mental health.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">American Horror Story: Ages, Heights and Relationship Statuses Of The Main Cast</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGifnqqVqHq4tMCtZKKso2K5qrfEZquoZaekv6x51qKroWWVq66vec%2Beq56qo2Q%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jerry-lawler-robbery-suspect-pleads-guilty.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jerry Lawler Robbery Suspect Pleads Guilty</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gothamchess-shocking-net-worth-revealed-is-levy-rozman-is-a-millionaire.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>GothamChess Shocking Net Worth Revealed- Is Levy Rozman Is A Millionaire?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
