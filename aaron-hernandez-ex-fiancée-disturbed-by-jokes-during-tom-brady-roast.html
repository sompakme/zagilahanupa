Multiple people, namely Brady himself, Nikki Glaser, and former Patriots wide receiver Julian Edelman, mention Hernandez amid their jokes. “Everyone always asks me how big Gronk’s d**k is,” Edelman said, referring to former Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski. “Now don’t get me wrong, it gets the job done. But there was this other Patriots tight end. Now he was hung.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Edelman’s joke alluded to the fact Hernandez hung himself in 2017, just days after being acquitted of his alleged 2012 <a href=#>double homicide</a> of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado in Boston. Glaser made a similar reference, saying “Give it up for zero-time Super Bowl champion Randy Moss. Why don’t you have a ring? What the hell, man, you’re one of the best ever. Drew Bledsoe has a ring. Aaron Hernandez had a ring… around his neck.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“The bar for a Patriots tight end was pretty low back then,” Tom Brady said in one of his jokes. “Block. Catch. Don’t murder.” This was a reference to Aaron Hernandez killing semi-professional football player Odin Lloyd in 2013.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">While this was entertaining to people who were present, Hernandez’s ex-fiancée, Shayanna Jenkins, was not amused. “It’s sad that I’m trying to raise my children in such a cruel world,” she told <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a>. Jenkins was especially concerned that her 11-year-old daughter, Avielle, was old enough to both hear and comprehend the jokes about her late father.</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">She recently shared a heartfelt post about her late fiancée on Instagram. “It takes as long as it takes. I will always wake up everyday only to remember you are not here and have to feel that ache all over again,” she wrote. “You are truly loved & missed.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">Aaron Hernandez’s brother,<a href=#> Dennis “D.J.” Hernandez</a>, got into some legal trouble in July 2023. He was arrested for conspiring to conduct shootings at the University of Connecticut and Brown University. <a rel=nofollow href=#>TMZ</a> reported that the Bristol Police Department had a working theory about Hernandez and how he could be a “danger to society.” They also spoke with key people who had interacted with him and received “unsettling text messages.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">“We’re taking lives if sh*t isn’t paid up,” one text message said. “It’s been years in planning just taking notes, names, and locations. They talked their way into this and it’s almost point game.” On social media, he wrote “Will I kill? Absolutely, I’ve warned my enemies so pay up front.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m">When Hernandez was arrested, he did not resist. Instead, he walked toward the police and encouraged them to shoot him. He was eventually detained and taken to a local medical facility. His bail was set at $250,000.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube"><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5aus7vNZp%2Beqp6Wu6Wx2WadopmemLKmecOiqq2topeypXnJqKKeq12pvK55wauYnbFdp7yiv9NmaGtrZG2Ed4KQcmY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alex-ernst-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-girlfriend-family-more.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alex Ernst Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Girlfriend, Family &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-kathy-ambush-ex-wife-of-clarence-thomas.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Kathy Ambush, Ex-Wife Of Clarence Thomas?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
