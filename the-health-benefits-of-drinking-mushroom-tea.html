As for the taste, you can certainly tell that it's healthy. Blended with hot water, Four Sigma Food's Instant Reishi—a powder blended with star anise, mint leaf, licorice root, and stevia—smells vaguely like a diluted cup of miso soup and is surprisingly sweet (from the stevia) but isn't all that different from a weak black tea. If you wanted to sip it during a work meeting (to balance out the stress said meeting might create), there's no real funky fungi scent that would give you away.</p><p>Originally posted March 1, 2015.
