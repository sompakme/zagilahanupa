As for the taste, you can certainly tell that it's healthy. Blended with hot water, Four Sigma Food's Instant Reishiâ€”a powder blended with star anise, mint leaf, licorice root, and steviaâ€”smells vaguely like a diluted cup of miso soup and is surprisingly sweet (from the stevia) but isn't all that different from a weak black tea. If you wanted to sip it during a work meeting (to balance out the stress said meeting might create), there's no real funky fungi scent that would give you away.</p><p>Originally posted March 1, 2015.
