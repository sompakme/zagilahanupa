He has won a remarkable 27 Billboard Music Awards in addition to four Grammy Awards, three Juno Awards, six American Music Awards, and three Juno Awards. <a href=#>Drake's flourishing music and television careers</a> have given him many opportunities to amass wealth, selling more digital singles than practically anyone else in the industry. He signed on with Nike and Air Jordan to produce the OVO Air Jordans, and in 2020, he will work with Bathing Ape to launch a clothing line. He has various brand endorsement deals.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With producer Noah Shebib and entrepreneur Oliver El-Khatib, Drake established his own record company, OVO Sound. Finally, Drake owns a whiskey company, as every lovely celebrity should. Finally, Drake holds a whiskey company, as every famous star should. Drake can live in luxury and royal comfort in numerous mansions spanning several countries thanks to his enormous riches via brand partnerships, music videos, television shows, movie cameos, social media marketing, and everything else possible.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="Drake: 6 Ways The Rapper Earns And Spends His Fortune" href=#>Drake: 6 Ways The Rapper Earns And Spends His Fortune</a></span></p><h2 id=the-yolo-estate>The YOLO Estate</h2><p>The Yolo Estate, which bears the name of Drake's famous song The Motto, started in 2012 when Drake bought a 12,500-square-foot estate in California's Hidden Hills. The Kardashians, Justin Bieber, and many other celebrities have called this region near Calabasas home. It is a 3-acre property and contains six bedrooms and 10 baths. Larry Pollack, the owner of Saddle Ranch, sold it to him for $7.7 million. The Hidden Hills residence went for a more subtle design with its facade, as modest as a mansion can be, even though it wasn't as immediately grand as his Toronto behemoth. The home has large, ranch-style wooden beams, cozy white and brown wood, and is designed in the English-Tudor architectural style. There is also a unique bookshelf in his bedroom.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=luxury-like-hefner>Luxury Like Hefner</h2><p>The <a href=#>rapper who has a massive car collection</a> owns an estate that has a large, lavish pool, a man-made grotto, and glowing water surrounded by cave walls. It was purportedly constructed to compete with Hugh Hefner's renowned Playboy pool. Drake's property also has a five-horse stable. The pool area is surrounded by statues of naked women and features wet bars, flat-screen televisions, waterfalls, and an 80-foot slide. Drake likes his mechanical bull, which is also housed in the mansion for his more ravenous partying squad, over his genuine breathing horses because he does not own any.</p><h2 id=neighbors-houses>Neighbors’ Houses</h2><p>Drake then purchased two more <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">homes in the very same neighborhood</a>. According to rumors, Drake promised his neighbors that he would buy their homes if his gatherings became too boisterous, loud, or out of control. Drake purchased the adjoining house for roughly $3 million a few years after buying the first estate, and he eventually paid about $4.5 million for the other neighbor's 1950s ranch-style home. These three structures form the Yolo Estate, a 6.7-acre Hidden Hills estate.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-s-100-million-toronto-mansion>Drake’s $100 Million Toronto Mansion</h2><p>Drake who has <a href=#>pursued different business ventures</a> owns a 50,000 square-foot 19th-century limestone manor house stands like a palace in the middle of one of Toronto's most elite neighborhoods, Bridal Path, after many years of building. Exotic woods surround the property's walls, framed by gleaming marble, granite, and limestone fences. A plain black and white limestone courtyard is accessible through the front gate. A masterpiece of bronze, the old-fashioned house was brought back to life by designer Ferris Rafauli and is now decorated with gold chandeliers, couches, antique bronze-framed mirrors, enormous white kitchens, and limestone floors and walls that glitter amid the statues, trophies, and other symbols of authority.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-limestone-monument>A Limestone Monument</h2><p>Every room is lavish, decorated with elaborate marble and brickwork, and immaculately kept. The <a href=#>rapper who is a known sneakerhead</a> owns the powerful, vibrant, almost psychedelic concert grand piano by Ferris Rafauli and Takashi Murakami is shown in one 44-foot-high room. It is filled to the brim with bubbles that, upon closer study, turn out to be skulls. A chandelier intended for the Metropolitan Opera in New York stands over it. There is a modest, hidden lounge space among the sparkling, royal halls that is dark with dazzling stars on the ceiling and dimly illuminating yellow stone among low couches. A whiskey and champagne bar emerges from the bed's headboard in his bedroom. Two additional amenities include a two-story closet and a 4,000-pound pure black marble tub.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-s-palace-is-an-athlete-s-dream>Drake’s Palace Is an Athlete’s Dream</h2><p>The house has many comforts one would anticipate from a rap superstar and celebrity but none of the corniness of classic hip-hop pads. It blends <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">classic elegance with contemporary style</a>. It has a basketball court the size of an NBA professional court, above which towers a vast skylight. Drake's favored Toronto Raptors might be practicing there or simply lounging about. It features an Olympic-sized swimming pool made of black granite, a top-notch recording studio with a retro vibe, and separate halls for his entertainment accolades and sports jerseys.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=drake-s-mark-on-toronto>Drake’s Mark on Toronto</h2><p>This mansion is one of a celebrity's most exquisite, empowering, and empirical homes ever held. In many respects, the <a href=#>rapper who has an impressive Guinness World record</a> wants this house to carry his legacy and to stand long after he has died away. Drake created a palace in Toronto that is expected to endure historically for a very long time while still upholding Drake's legacy. For one of the rapper's videos, Toosie Slide, where a custom-built mansion is shown, Drake's Toronto home served as the location for filming. Everything at Drake's house seems to have a backstory, from the Kobe jerseys on display to the whole collection of honors in the trophy room to the picture of Mao by Andy Warhol that is unassumingly sitting in the background.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-tuscan-style-mansion>A Tuscan-Style Mansion</h2><p>The well-known rapper paid $50 million, or $35 million less than the asking price, for another property in Beverly Hills earlier of March 2022 in an off-market purchase. The property was formerly owned by Robbie Williams. The home's 25,000-square-foot garage can store 11 vehicles. The ten bedrooms and twenty-two baths are located in the Tuscan-style home. The Daily Mail reports features to include a mosaic-tiled pool, an outdoor kitchen, a wine cellar, a game room, a gym, a screening room, a tennis court, and an elevator.</p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a class=bc-title-link title="The 9 Most Expensive Watches In Drake's Collection" href=#>The 9 Most Expensive Watches In Drake's Collection</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Fortune</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rap TV</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Real Estate AU</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpa2oqr%2B6ecCrmqGhpJqwtcHRnmaaZZykvKx5wK1kmqScYsGpsYyhpq6rlah6pb7ApJxmoJGoeqSty6WcnWWYpLqmew%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./andy-dalton-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Andy Dalton Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./15-actors-with-the-most-whacko-beliefs.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>15 Actors With The Most Whacko Beliefs</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
