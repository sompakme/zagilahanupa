What more could you ask for?</p><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><h3>Why should I avoid aluminum in my deodorant?</h3><p>Aluminum is found in some deodorants and particularly in products with an antiperspirant effect. They work by plugging the pores of your underarms to reduce sweating. It may be effective, but is it good for your skin? For some people, not so much. While most specific health concerns around aluminum salts in deodorant have been disproven, some people have found aluminum to cause irritation. The armpit is a particularly sensitive area with thin skin so that irritation can be an issue. That being said, everyone is different. Try shopping around and testing the effects of various deodorants to see what works for you. If you’re concerned about aluminum, this list is here to help.</p><h3>What other ingredients should I avoid in my deodorant?</h3><p>This is a difficult question to answer, as everyone’s skin is different, and people have different needs when it comes to deodorant. Ingredients like alcohol can be quite drying, which can be a problem for people with sensitive skin. Sometimes, strong artificial fragrances can also be quite sensitizing. Another good general rule is avoiding ingredients you wouldn’t want in your shampoo or skincare. For instance, if you avoid irritating sulfates and parabens, it’s probably best to make sure there are none of these in your deodorant as well.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3>What is the difference between a deodorant and an antiperspirant?</h3><p>Sometimes, these terms are used interchangeably. However, generally, antiperspirants stop sweating in the first place, while deodorants reduce the odor. The issue is that most antiperspirants use ingredients like aluminum salts to block the pores, which can irritate some people. They also can be more drying.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKCfpXq4tdOhZK6rX6OyuL%2BOm5ysrF2Wuba5yKespmWWp7KmecOepp2nopa7tb%2BMppynZw%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-wins-fails-of-the-2010-mtv-video-music-awards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The WINs &amp;amp; FAILs Of The 2010 MTV Video Music Awards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./juroses-parents-where-are-they-from-real-name-and-ethnicity.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Juroses Parents: Where Are They From?
