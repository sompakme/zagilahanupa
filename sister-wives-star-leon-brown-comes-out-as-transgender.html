My name is Leon or Leo (i love both) and my pronouns are they/them.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Introducing-Leon-Kody-Meri-Browns-Child-Comes-Out-Transgender-00001.jpg><p class=x_p1>The TLC personality went on to detail their journey toward&nbsp;figuring out their identity, revealing&nbsp;how long they’ve known who they are.<span class=x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_p1>“I was pretty young & unfortunately I grew up in a context that was incredibly gendered & restrictive,”&nbsp;Leon explained. “So I continued to be socialized as a girl & later a woman. and here’s the thing, I’m finally ready to share my favorite self with the world. and that self is incredibly <a href=#>genderqueer, trans, and unapologetic</a>.”</p><p class=x_p1>The Utah native called being queer and trans some of their&nbsp;“favorite parts of myself.”&nbsp;However,&nbsp;admitted that there are “so many things that I am learning to love about myself through the process” as they “continually evolve” to be the&nbsp;most authentic version of themselves.</p><p class=x_p1>Leon concluded the post <a href=#>by setting important boundaries</a>.&nbsp;“If you choose to not use my correct name or pronouns, then you do not need to speak to or about me,” they said. “My name is Leo or Leon, and my pronouns are they/them.&nbsp;Please only refer to me in that way.”</p><p class=x_p1>Kody, 53, has yet to react to the announcement and the two are not currently following each other on the social media platform. Meri, 51, however, shared Leon’s post via her Instagram Story on Tuesday.</p><p class=x_p1>“You are my sunshine,” she wrote at the time.<span class=x_Apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span></p><p class=x_p1>Kody and Meri’s only child&nbsp;previously came out as a lesbian to their polygamous family during an episode of Sister Wives in 2017.&nbsp;Leon&nbsp;has been engaged to partner <a href=#><strong>Audrey Kriss</strong></a> since January 2019 after the <a href=#>program manager proposed</a> during the Women’s March in Washington, D.C.</p><p class=x_p1>During a March 2020 episode of the TLC series, Leon <a href=#>shared some&nbsp;intimate details</a> of their personal life and&nbsp;described&nbsp;the support they received from their fiancée. “In my teens, I felt very devoted to the church that I was raised in,” they explained. “I wanted to live polygamy. I think it was a way to protect myself from, like, coming out to myself, really.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=x_p1>Leon continued, “Religious institutions are spaces where there’s rules and if you are not following these rules or guidelines you can feel pretty marginalized and I did feel that way with my church. But with my family, I found so much comfort and they love me anyway. They love me and they love Audrey, and they love our love.”</p><p class=x_p1>Kriss, for their part, <a href=#>came out as transgender</a> in December 2021.&nbsp;“I just wanted to let you know that I am transgender, and my pronouns are they/them. I’m still going by Audrey,” they wrote via Instagram at the time. “I don’t want to hide myself from the world anymore. I am so incredibly excited! I am also scared. I am scared of the hate I’ll receive, the things people I care about will say about me, and violence. As a white, masculine presenting person comes a lot of privilege, and I am still scared.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasoaOpsrN51qKtnqtdqMGivoylnKimXZe%2FsMPNZpqopZWoerDB02aYrGWkp66vv8aepZ2domQ%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-most-expensive-brand-endorsements-of-soccer-players-as-of-2022.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 Most Expensive Brand Endorsements Of Soccer Players, As Of 2022</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rachel-bilson-wears-bikini-while-pregnant-with-hayden-christensen-pic.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rachel Bilson Wears Bikini While Pregnant With Hayden Christensen: Pic</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
