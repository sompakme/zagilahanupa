Her Eras Tour is constantly making headlines and it seems everyone is talking about which surprise songs she is going to play next. Her music has been a staple in society since she first began releasing songs in 2006. Swift has gone through many genre changes, releasing music in country, pop, and alternative genres. The singer has been criticized for going through boyfriends just as often, but she has been in a serious relationship for the past six years with boyfriend <a href=# rel=nofollow>Joe Alwyn</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sadly, it was reported in early April 2023 that the celebrity couple had parted ways. The split reportedly happened several weeks prior. Fans were devastated by the news, as it seemed Swift and Alwyn were it in for the long haul. Here is a look back on Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn’s relationship.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Jimmy Fallon Was Holding Back Tears After Taylor Swift Surprised Him With One Of The Most Emotional Moments On The Tonight Show</a></span></p><h2 id=who-is-joe-alwyn><span class=item-num>11 </span><span>Who Is Joe Alwyn?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/joe-alwyn-on-the-kelly-clarkson-show.jpg><p>Joe Alwyn, whose full name is Joseph Matthew Alwyn, is an English actor. Alwyn had an interest in acting from a young age. He joined the National Youth Theatre as a teenager and acted in student productions at Edinburgh Festival Fringe. He has won a Satellite Award, a Critics’ Choice Movie Award, and the Trophée Chopard at the Cannes Film Festival.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>His first feature film was the 2016 movie Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk. Alwyn clearly started out his career strong, as this role was his first credited role outside of student and short films. Since gaining success with the war drama, he has also appeared in popular films such as The Favourite, Boy Erased, Mary Queen of Scots, and Harriet. He joined the cast of Hulu’s Conversations with Friends and portrayed the character of Nick. His most recent films, both of which premiered in 2022, were Stars at Noon and Catherine Called Birdy.</p><h2 id=how-did-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-meet><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>How Did Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Meet?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-recording.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift is known in the entertainment industry for having many famous boyfriends. <a href=# rel=nofollow>Ellen DeGeneres actually poked fun at the singer for her dating life</a> while Swift was on DeGeneres’s show. After so many public relationships with stars such as Jake Gyllenhaal and Harry Styles, it is not surprising that Swift is much more cautious now about what she allows the public to know about her private life.</p><p>This is certainly true about her relationship with actor Joe Alwyn. The two have never technically revealed how they first met, but fans have deduced they crossed paths for the first time at the 2016 Met Gala. Fans’ suspect this due to Swift’s song “Dress” from her album Reputation. A line in the song reads “Flashback to when you met me / your buzz cut / and my hair bleached.” This line perfectly described how Swift and Alwyn looked at the Met Gala, suggesting this was when their romance started.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=when-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-confirmed-their-relationship><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>When Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Confirmed Their Relationship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-1.jpg><p>News of Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn’s relationship did not circulate until May 2017. The Sun first reported the new couple, with a source saying “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">Taylor and Joe are the real deal, this is a very serious relationship.</a>” The couple had supposedly been dating in secret for several months, and “after what happened with Tom Hiddleston, they were determined to keep it quiet.” Swift had spent a lot of time in tabloid headlines when she was with Hiddleston, so she made the choice to fly “in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.” Swift had also “been walking around with Joe in London using disguises, like scarves and hats, to keep her identity under wraps.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift herself later confirmed that she was dating Alwyn in a diary entry included in the deluxe edition of her album Lover. She wrote, “I’m essentially based in London, hiding out trying to protect us from the nasty world that just wants to ruin things.” The singer also confirmed she had kept the relationship private for a while, saying “we have been together and no one has found out for three months now.”</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>How Zooey Deschanel Really Felt About Working With Taylor Swift In New Girl</a></span></p><h2 id=did-joe-alwyn-support-taylor-swift-rsquo-s-career><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Did Joe Alwyn Support Taylor Swift’s Career?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-studio.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As one of the biggest singers in the entire world, Taylor Swift has a very demanding job. If she’s not on stage performing to thousands of fans, she’s likely writing her next album at all hours of the day. Joe Alwyn understands this, as he is also in the entertainment industry, and stood by Swift through her challenging schedule.</p><p>Alwyn was seen numerous times attending her concerts, whether he was backstage or hidden somewhere in the crowd. Though their public outings together were rather rare, Alwyn did attend her appearance at the 2017 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball in New York. The actor was also at the opening night of her Reputation tour. Fans loved seeing Alwyn support Swift, and they seemed like the perfect match for each other.</p><h2 id=how-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-vacationed-together><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>How Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Vacationed Together</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/joe-alwyn-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As famous celebrities, it is no surprise that Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn have taken some incredible vacations together. The first time they were seen traveling together, however, was for a very mundane occasion. In June 2017, the two traveled to Nashville in order to spend time with Swift’s family. This was the first time Alwyn has spent an extended amount of time with the Swift family.</p><p>The couple’s other vacations, however, were much more glamorous. They were spotted together in Turks and Caicos in the summer of 2018, and in Paris the summer after that. Swift and Alwyn strolled the streets of the European city in baseball caps and sneakers and had breakfast at the famous Café de Flore. They celebrities New Year’s in 2020 in the Maldives. Swift visited Alwyn in Ireland in late 2021 while he was there filming Hulu’s Conversations with Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=joe-alwyn-valued-privacy-with-taylor-swift><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joe Alwyn Valued Privacy With Taylor Swift</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Joe-Alwyn-Addresses-Those-Taylor-Swift-Engagement-Rumors--.jpg><p>Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn kept as much of their relationship private as possible. Before Swift, Alwyn was not nearly as large of a name as he is today. He was not used to the public poking into his personal life, and he made a choice with Swift to keep prying eyes out of their relationship.</p><p>That did not stop interviewers from asking about his relationship with the famous singer. British Vogue attempted to get Alwyn to open up about his relationship with Swift, but Alwyn refused to share any details. “<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">I’m aware people want to know about that side of things</a>,” the actor said in response to the prying question. “I think we have been successfully very private and that has now sunk in for people… but I really prefer to talk about work.” He also stated in later interviews that he did not want their relationship picked apart by the press or public.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-support-joe-alwyn-rsquo-s-career><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Did Taylor Swift Support Joe Alwyn’s Career?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/untitled-design-202.png><p>Joe Alwyn has a career of his own, a very successful one at that. He has received numerous awards for his work in acting and has appeared in many popular and critically acclaimed productions. Though Taylor Swift is a much larger name than Alwyn, and many have attempted to set her up with other famous celebrities, she has not let that affect their relationship. Instead, she has been a big supporter of Alwyn’s acting career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Swift was present at the 2019 Golden Globes, during which Alwyn’s film The Favourite had five nominations. That same year, the singer actually skipped the Grammy Awards to attend the BAFTAs with Alwyn. The couple had fun at an afterparty of the event in London while the Grammys happened in Los Angeles. Swift has also given Alwyn shout outs on her social media, one of which was a support of his Hulu show Conversations with Friends on her Instagram story.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel=nofollow>Taylor Swift, Selena Gomez, And Justin Bieber Share More Than Just Singing Voices: Their Faces Hurt Too (Just Like Us)</a></span></p><h2 id=taylor-swift-set-boundaries-on-her-relationship><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Taylor Swift Set Boundaries On Her Relationship</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/taylor-swift-performing.jpg><p>Taylor Swift spent a great deal of her career dodging questions about her love life. For a time, she was boiled down to a girl who writes songs about boys. While it is true that she has written many songs about her former relationships, she is far from the only one in the music industry who has done so. Swift decided that she wanted separation between her professional public life and her personal life, and she made that clear with her relationship with Joe Alwyn.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I’ve learned that if I do, people think it’s up for discussion, and <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">our relationship isn’t up for discussion</a>,” Swift said after questions about her love life from The Guardian. “If you and I were having a glass of wine right now, we’d be talking about it—but it’s just that it goes out into the world.” In other words, Swift has no problem gushing about her boyfriend to people around her, but she does not want or need every eye in the world on her private life. “That’s where the boundary is, and that’s where my life has become manageable. I really want to keep it feeling manageable.”</p><h2 id=what-taylor-swift-songs-are-about-joe-alwyn><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>What Taylor Swift Songs Are About Joe Alwyn?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/joe-alwyn-conversations-with-friends-nick-conway.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Taylor Swift is the queen of romance and heartbreak in the music industry. Her relationship and breakup songs have become anthems for people around the world. In the six years she’s been with Joe Alwyn, she has not had a lot of personal heartbreak to write about. Instead, Swift tapped into the love they shared for inspiration, and she wrote some pretty incredible songs as Alwyn as the muse. Thankfully, Alwyn thinks it is very flattering!</p><p>The first album of Swift’s that featured songs inspired by Alwyn was Reputation. Songs “… Ready for it?,” “End Game,” “Delicate,” “Gorgeous,” “King of My Heart,” “Dress,” “Call It What You Want,” and “New Year’s Day” are all about the English actor. In other words, every love song on the album is about Alwyn. The same is essentially true about the Lover album, the most obvious being “Lover,” “Cornelia Street,” and “London Boy.” Fans deduced that “Peace” from Folklore was also talking about Alwyn, as was “Love Story Short” from Evermore. Swift’s most recent album, Midnights, also has several songs about Alwyn, including “Lavender Haze,” Labyrinth,” and “Mastermind.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=did-taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-write-songs-together><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Did Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn Write Songs Together?</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/joe-alwyn.jpg><p>Taylor Swift was blown away when she discovered that her boyfriend Joe Alwyn has a talent for music and songwriting. Initially, Alwyn kept his name off her records. The actor used the name William Bowery on their songs, but Swift later confirmed that Bowery is in fact Alwyn. The name William Bowery comes from his great-grandfather William Alwyn, who composed music, and the New York City neighborhood of Bowery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Over the course of their six year relationship, Swift and Alwyn wrote many songs together. They began collaborating on her album Folklore, which awarded them both with a Grammy. On the album, Alwyn co-wrote “Exile” and “Betty,” and he also helped produce several other songs. On Evermore, the actor helped write “Champagne Problems,” “Coney Island,” and “Evermore.” He also helped write “Sweet Nothing” on Midnights.</p><h2 id=taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-39-s-break-up><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Taylor Swift And Joe Alwyn's Break-Up</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/taylor-swift-lavender-haze.jpg><p>Unfortunately, it seems that the six-year relationship between Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn has come to an end. Their breakup was first reported in early April 2023, and though fans have been desperately trying to disprove the rumor, sources confirm that they split several weeks ago. It was a civil breakup, as the two celebrities realized they were very different people and Alwyn wants more privacy than she can give him. Their split is the reason why Alwyn has not been seen supporting Swift on her Eras Tour.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The news of their split comes only months after engagement rumors were circulating for Swift and Alwyn. They were never engaged, but one source has claimed that they were talking about getting married as recently as a few months ago. The breakup between Swift and Alwyn is very upsetting for fans, and some even believe <a href=# rel=nofollow>shows a troubling trend for the famous singer</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1lmqSybq3LsLCnZaKauaLAyKilrKCZpXq1tcyeo6KmlWKvs7HApKypZZ2esa%2B1xqGraA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zailetsplay-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>ZaiLetsPlay Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./these-are-brad-pitt-s-top-10-rules-for-success.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>These Are Brad Pitt's Top 10 Rules For Success</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
