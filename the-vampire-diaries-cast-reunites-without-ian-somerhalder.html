The actress, 34, winked at the camera before smiling and passing the phone to <strong>Paul Wesley</strong>, who portrayed Stefan Salvatore.</p><p>Wesley, 41, gave his phone a confused look before covering the camera and transitioning to <strong>Kat Graham</strong>, who played Bonnie Bennett. Graham, 34, checked herself out before passing the video to <strong>Candice King</strong> (Caroline Forbes), who held her drink up to the camera.</p><p>Next, <strong>Kayla Ewell</strong> (Vicki Donovan) appeared on screen and smiled before <strong>Claire Holt</strong> (Rebekah Mikaelson) took control. She zoomed in on her face before the clip transitioned to <strong>Michael Trevino</strong> (Tyler Lockwood), who was driving his car. Dobrev then showed up one more time to wrap up the TikTok.</p><p>Although the cast was not physically together to reunite, fans were quick to notice that Somerhalder, 44, who played Damon Salvatore, was not included in the clip.</p><p>“We need Ian somerhalder,” one follower wrote, while another questioned, “You included tyler but not damon?!” A third social media user wondered, “Where was Ian somerhalder??”</p><p>Dobrev and Somerhalder dated in real life and on the show. The duo began their real-life romance in 2010 after season 1 finished wrapping.</p><p>In May 2013, Us Weekly confirmed they had split<a href=#> after three years of dating</a>. Dobrev and Somerhalder’s characters, however, sparked their romantic relationship on season 4 of The Vampire Diaries, which premiered in October 2013.</p><p>The following year at the 2014 People’s Choice Awards, Dobrev and Somerhalder won Best On-Screen Chemistry.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/The-%E2%80%98Vampire-Diaries-Cast-Reunited-in-Sentimental-TikTok-Without-Ian-Somerhalder2.jpg><p>While accepting the award, the duo performed a skit while addressing their breakup. “We started dating on the show,” Dobrev said while explaining the plot of the CW series.</p><p>“Then we started dating in real life,” Somerhalder added.</p><p>Dobrev continued, “And then we broke up in real life.”</p><p>Somerhalder then told the audience that their “characters are still dating on the show,” while Dobrev quipped, “It’s a good thing it’s not awkward!”</p><p>The duo concluded their skit by laughing as Somerhalder gave Dobrev a kiss on the cheek.</p><p>The following year, Somerhalder moved on with<strong> Nikki Reed</strong>. The pair tied the knot in 2015 and have since welcomed two kids together: daughter Bodhi Soleil, 6, and a son, 4 months. Dobrev, meanwhile, <a href=#>started dating</a> <strong>Shaun White</strong> in 2020.</p><p>Despite their breakup, Somerhalder and Dobrev never made it awkward on set.</p><p>Holt, 35, later opened up about Somerhalder and Dobrev’s relationship and post-breakup dynamic during a May 2021 podcast episode of “Not Skinny But Not Fat.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“They kept it super professional,” she said. “It<a href=#> never got weird</a> … They did a great job at managing that. But it’s hard. For a lot of people, it’s really tough.”</p><p>Although Dobrev left the series after season 6 concluded in 2015, The Vampire Diaries continued to film until March 2017.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2rrq68yKucZpyZlr%2BqsdJmmpqrpGK%2FpsHNoqueq12strW0zq6rZqGRo3q0u8yeqaGZnJmys3s%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tyson-fury-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tyson Fury Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-truth-about-bradley-cooper-s-relationship-with-his-daughter-lea.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Truth About Bradley Coopers Relationship With His Daughter, Lea</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
