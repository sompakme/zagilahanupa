For that reason, it makes sense that many members of Saved by the Bell's cast seem like they will be bonded for life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/saved-by-the-bell-reunion-with-jimmy-fallon.jpg><p>Sadly, however, Dustin Diamond's relationship with most of his former Saved by the Bell co-stars was far from close when he passed away. As a result, Diamond was excluded from all the reunions including the one put together by Jimmy Fallon and the revival series.</p><p>During interviews, none of Saved by the Bell's stars ever spoke about hating Diamond. Instead, they mostly expressed their hope that Diamond would recover from any struggles he had. The reason why most of Diamond's co-stars didn't have a relationship with him is they felt they couldn't trust him.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Everything To Know About Mario Lopez's Super Secretive Date Nights With His Wife, Courtney</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>That distrust stems from a book titled "Behind the Bell" which was released under Diamond's name as an autobiography. In "Behind the Bell", a slew of scandalous claims were made about Diamond's Saved by the Bell co-stars.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dustin-diamond-s-relationship-with-dennis-haskins-was-shockingly-different-than-his-feud-with-the-rest-of-his-saved-by-the-bell-co-stars.jpg><p>Years after "Behind the Bell" was released, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Diamond publicly apologized for the book</a>. Furthermore, Diamond has said the book was full of mistruths that someone else wrote after he spoke to them very briefly.</p><p>While Diamond recanted all the claims in "Behind the Bell", the fact remains that the book was very damaging for his co-stars. With that in mind, it makes sense that most of his castmates kept their distance from him if for no other reason than to make sure Diamond didn't make any new claims about them.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=how-close-were-saved-by-the-bell-39-s-dustin-diamond-and-dennis-haskins>How Close Were Saved By The Bell's Dustin Diamond and Dennis Haskins?</h2><p>Between 1987 and the year 2000, Dustin Diamond and Dennis Haskins worked together in four different shows. Aside from the 2020 revival series, the two men appeared in every iteration of the Saved by the Bell franchise.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Saved-By-The-Bell-Cast.jpg><p>First off, the two actors starred in Good Morning, Miss Bliss, the show that was retooled to become Saved by the Bell. For four seasons, Haskins and Diamond co-starred in Saved the Bell together. Once the short-lived show Saved by the Bell: The College Years premiered, Diamond starred in the show and Haskins had a guest role in one episode.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Haskins and Diamond would also both appear in the franchise's two specials. In 1992 and 1994, Saved by the Bell: Hawaiian Style and Saved by the Bell: Wedding in Las Vegas aired with both actors involved.</p><p>While Haskins and Diamond co-starred in all those projects, something changed once they worked on Saved by the Bell: The New Class together. For six seasons of that show which actually lasted longer than any other Saved by the Bell series, Diamond and Haskins became a comedy duo.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Saved By The Bellâ€™s Most Controversial Episodes Could've Gotten The Show Canceled</a></span></p><p>After so many years of starring in the same projects, Diamond and Haskins spent endless hours together. With that in mind, it would have been a great thing if the two actors became friends, but that wasn't necessarily going to happen.</p><p>Throughout television history, there have been many examples of co-stars who worked together for years despite hating each other. With that in mind and the fact that Diamond had a frayed relationship with many of his former Saved by the Bell co-stars, he easily could have not gotten along with Haskins.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2015, Dennis Haskins participated in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session. During that process, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Haskins was asked a very loaded question about Diamond</a>. "What are your feelings on Dustin Diamond and the behind-the-scenes book he wrote?"</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dennis-haskins-with-his-thumbs-up.jpg><p>When the book that is credited to Diamond was released, it made everyone involved with Saved by the Bell look bad. As a result, it would have been understandable if Haskins had an ax to grind when it comes to that subject.</p><p>Instead, Haskins only responded with kind words for Diamond. On top of that, Haskins wrote about the special bond he developed with Diamond after working with him for so long during the younger actor's formative years.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"I worked with Dustin Diamond from when he was 11 years old until 20. Dustin and I actually became a team on The New Class. Dustin will always have a special place with me." Haskins was later asked if a TV movie that was adapted from Diamond's book was truthful. Again, Haskins had Diamond's back.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Why They Got Rid Of Max From Saved By The Bell And What Ed Alonzo Is Really Doing Now</a></span></p><p>"I will just refer you back to the last thing that Dustin has been saying - that he didn't write the book, that he had an hour conversation with somebody, who then turned around and wrote what you saw. Make your own judgments as to whether it was accurate or not. Because I did not watch it. I lived it, I didn't need to see somebody's version."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Finally, Haskins was asked about Saved by the Bell: The New Class. As part of his response, Haskins wrote about how delighted he was to become a comedy team with Diamond. "I had the most fun doing comedy as a team with Dustin."</p><p>Of course, it takes two to tango so hearing from Dennis Haskins about Dustin Diamond isn't enough. Instead, to be sure Diamond and Haskins truly were close, the former Screech actor also needed to weigh in.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/dennis-haskins-with-his-thumb-up.jpg><p>After Diamond's time starring in the Saved by the Bell franchise ended, he sadly spent years struggling to get by. Between that and coverage of Diamond's broken relationship with many of his former Saved by the Bell co-stars, he rarely got asked about the good things in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2016, Diamond made an appearance on Dr. Oz's talk show. During that show, Diamond mostly spoke about his struggles and the scandalous parts of his life. However, when Diamond was asked about his former Saved by the Bell co-stars, he <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">confirmed that he had a close bond with Haskins</a> and one more of his former castmates.</p><p>"Mario Lopez and I speak frequently and Dennis Haskins and I speak frequently."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibrquknrtusMiapKimlGLAosLEnWSbsV2ptaZ5wZ6jpWWTlsC1ecWerJ1lopq5osDIqKWsoJmleri106FknZ2eo7a0eceaqqShnqh8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./frank-oz-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>Â«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Frank Oz Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./where-are-the-stars-of-glow-now.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;Â»</span><p class=pager__title>Where Are The Stars Of GLOW Now?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
