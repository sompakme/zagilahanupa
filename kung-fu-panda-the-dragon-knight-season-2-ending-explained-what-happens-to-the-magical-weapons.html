Incidentally, the Defender is, in all honesty, Tikal’s ruler, Zuma, who uses one of the Easing up Wheels. She utilizes it to counter the strike of Aknas’ mechanical beasts that come and take the collect of Tikal in light of the fact that their own town is shrinking endlessly because of an absence of downpour. In spite of the fact that everybody believed that Akna should have the other Wheel, it turns out she had given it over to Alfie, Edge’s brother, who took it to Britain with him to annihilate it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Veruca, who possesses the Wugao Glove and the Breeze Cap, is coming for the Whip and the Wheels. Following an incredible clash inside a seething spring of gushing lava, Po and his steadfast buddies figure out how to overcome Klaus and Veruca. However, tragically, Zuma intercedes at a vital second and takes the glove and cap from Veruca. Albeit the Mythical beast Fighters neglect to get every one of the weapons, they figure out how to pursue off the weasel kin, and Edge finishes her central goal of finding them and finishing them.</p><p>In any case, the weapons should now be detracted from Zuma, who is relaxing in her freshly discovered greatness. Subsequent to assuming command over Po’s body, Expert Mastodon drives the crew into fight.
