Onlookers also claim that his security did not help ward off the assailants during the altercation. It also appears that Benny The Butcher was not present at the time of the incident.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just saw Freddie Gibbs get beat up and his chain took while I was eating in buffalo Ny <a href=# rel=nofollow>@FreddieGibbs</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Akademiks</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@WORLDSTAR</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#explore</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#WSHH</a></p><p>— Torycolion (@ToryRogers15) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 15, 2022</a></p><p lang=en dir=ltr>I just saw Freddie Gibbs get beat up and his chain took while I was eating in buffalo Ny <a href=# rel=nofollow>@FreddieGibbs</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@Akademiks</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>@WORLDSTAR</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#explore</a> <a href=# rel=nofollow>#WSHH</a></p><p>— Torycolion (@ToryRogers15) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 15, 2022</a></p><p>However, the “Big Boss Rabbit” rapper still made it to his performance at the Town Ballroom later that evening, albeit donning a mask and showing noticeable swelling in his face in various photos and video clips captured during the night. Fans also pointed out that as per usual Gibbs wasn’t wearing his signature iced-out rabbit chain, further fueling speculation that the rapper had been robbed. Yet, the 39-year-old later posted a photo of what appears to be his rabbit chain on social media before deleting the post, all but confirming an altercation had indeed taken place.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>my trunk got more blocks than dikembe<a href=# rel=nofollow>@FreddieGibbs</a><br>Town Ballroom , Buffalo NY <a href=# rel=nofollow>pic.twitter.com/gZHQdsTm2R</a></p><p>— J RUGG (@JustinRuggiero) <a href=# rel=nofollow>May 15, 2022</a></p><p>The tension between Benny The Butcher and Freddie Gibbs first surfaced in March, when Benny said that the former collaborators’ working relationship had “came and went” during an interview on Spotify Greenroom. It “came and went, to be honest with you,” Benny said, before adding, “It’s all love.”</p><p>In response, Gibbs took to social media to address Benny’s comment, uploading a post and asking that Benny not mention his name or reference him in interviews. “N***a said working with Freddie Gibbs came and went,” Freddie said in the clip. “I know some other sh*t that came and went, too, n***a. … Just keep my name out y’all mouth man, when y’all talking to people who are doing interviews and sh*t. Just say ‘Next question, man. I don’t want to talk about that n***a, man.’ Just say, ‘Next motherfu*kin’ question.’ For real.”</p><p>During a visit to the Drink Champs podcast, Benny gave his take on the beef, which he explained came from a remark Gibbs made on social media. “Really, it ain’t nothing… I don’t get too into rap relationships with n***as ‘cause a lot of times it don’t be real,” said the Tana Talk 4 rapper at the time. “That n***a put a tweet up or some weird sh*t and I wouldn’t know why he did that sh*t.” He continued, adding, “I don’t even care to ponder on it because this sh*t will get crazy if you start letting your feelings in this sh*t.”</p><p><span class=embed-youtube></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XBnmWcp51ku6bD0micp6yVp8Gitc2mnKesX5u%2FprDDopxmn5mXr7R5wKWjnp%2BVmbm6ecCsqpqtnKmypXnRqJmbnZRivK9506isq2WjqbyxeZBram1uZmeGc3%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./johnny-cash-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Johnny Cash Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./francesca-nora-bateman-how-old-is-jason-bateman-daughter.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Francesca Nora Bateman: How Old Is Jason Bateman Daughter?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
