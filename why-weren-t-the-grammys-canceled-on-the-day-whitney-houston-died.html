But others begged to differ, stressing that the idea of partying just seemed quite inconsiderate.</p><h2 id=the-grammys-continue-after-whitney-houston-s-death>The Grammys Continue After Whitney Houston’s Death</h2><p>Just hours after Houston’s body was removed from the Beverly Hilton Hotel, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Davis went ahead with his pre-Grammys party</a>, which included dozens of celebrities in attendance including Alicia Keys, Swizz Beatz, Brandy, Diddy, Kim Kardashian, Toni Braxton, and many more.</p><p>And while the celebs were quick to gush in interviews, saying that they were all celebrating the life of Houston, fans were somewhat disturbed that on the same day that the legendary singer died (at the same hotel), Davis decides to move ahead with his party to “honor” her legacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What Controversy From Early In Beyoncé’s Career Has Mostly Been Forgotten?</a></span></p><p>One fan had taken to Twitter, writing: “I don’t understand how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">these people are partying at the Beverly Hilton Hotel</a> when Whitney Houston literally just died in one of the rooms a few hours ago. If that’s not weird then I don’t know what is.”</p><p>Another chimed in, venting: “How rude of Kim K, Diddy and the rest of them to show up to a party that’s supposed to honor Whitney Houston, but she literally just died this afternoon and they think it’s not too soon to be doing this? I understand the idea behind it but this doesn’t sit well with me at all.”</p><p>According to Washington Post, a moment of silence was given to the “I Will Always Love You” singer, before Davis was said to have given a partial tribute to the woman he would go on to and turn into a global superstar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Whitney was a beautiful person and a talent beyond compare,” he said.</p><p>“She graced this stage with her regal presence and gave so many memorable performances here over the years.
