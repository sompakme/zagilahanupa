It all started back in 2010 when she shot to fame through Nickelodeon's show, Victorious.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Grande’s musical career has soared to incredible heights, earning her two Grammys, a BRIT Award, and an impressive nine MTV Video Music Awards. She also ventured into the world of cosmetics, launching her brand, r.e.m. beauty, in November 2021. Adding to her list of accomplishments, the singer is <a href=#>currently preparing to grace the big screen in the movie adaptation of Wicked</a>, where she portrays the good witch, Glinda.</p><p>While Grande is widely recognized as a leading figure in the music industry, the noticeable evolution of her voice and accent over the years confused her fans about what could have affected her real speaking voice.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-was-slammed-for-her-confusing-voice-changes-during-interviews>Ariana Grande Was Slammed For Her Confusing Voice Changes During Interviews</h2><p>In 2010, Ariana Grande captured public attention through her role as Cat Valentine on Nickelodeon's Victorious. Known for her vibrant red hair, soulful ballads, and trademark high-pitched voice, her unique speaking voice left a lasting impression on her fans.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Inside-Ariana-Grandes-Preparation-For-Wicked.jpg><p>However, a TikTok video went viral featuring a compilation of interview clips with Grande’s changing voice spanning from 2013 to 2022. Although her Cat Valentine voice was a character choice, some interviews from 2013 showed her speaking in a similar manner.</p><p>As time passed, distinct changes in her voice became evident. By 2014, Grande's voice had adopted a lower, raspier tone, which persisted through 2016 and 2017. The most significant shift occurred in 2018 when her voice seemed to transform the most. While it's natural for voices to evolve over nine years, many TikTok users commented not only on the pitch alterations but also on changes in her accent, particularly referencing a 2018 interview.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>How Many Tattoos Did Pete Davidson Get For Kim Kardashian And Ariana Grande?</a></span></p><p>Eventually, Grande's voice returned to a higher pitch and faster rhythm until a 2022 clip, which showcased an entirely new intonation that surprised fans. As a globally recognized singer, Ariana Grande has conducted numerous interviews and enthralled audiences with her hit songs.</p><p>Nevertheless, keen observers noticed differences in her speaking voice in a video from her 2019 appearance on the Zach Sang Show. The footage sparked confusion among viewers that led to a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit discussion about her changing voice</a>, with some noting that her voice seems to change in each new video they encounter.</p><h2 id=ariana-grande-39-s-changing-voice-is-allegedly-due-to-the-chameleon-effect>Ariana Grande's Changing Voice Is Allegedly Due To The Chameleon Effect</h2><p>Ariana Grande shared a question-and-answer video for her beauty brand, R.E.M on Youtube, but fans were quick to notice a significant change in her voice since filming for Wicked.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Normally known for her relatively deep voice with an American accent, in the new video, her voice sounded noticeably higher, softer, and had a touch of a European twang, resembling her Wicked character, Glinda. Some people have previously observed that she tends to mirror the voices of those around her, which might explain the difference.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Is-Ariana-Grandes-Excessive-Tanning-Proof-Of-Her-Race-Fishing.jpg><p>In the 11-minute YouTube clip, Grande addressed questions from fans, including her role as Glinda in the upcoming Wicked movie. Social media users were quick to comment on the perceived change in her voice. One commented, "Why does ariana grande have a new voice or accent every year?" while the other one wrote, "lol the three different voices in one video."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Amid criticism over her new accent, some fans defended the singer, stating that she sounds normal and that people shouldn't be so concerned. Others suggested that she might be subconsciously adopting the accents of those she interacts with, a phenomenon known as the Chameleon Effect.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What Ariana Grande Has Said About Her Perfume Collection And What They Actually Cost</a></span></p><p>As per a study in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, the Chameleon Effect pertains to the unconscious mimicry of the postures, mannerisms, facial expressions, and other behaviors exhibited by one's interaction partners. This leads to a passive and unintentional adjustment of one's own behavior to align with that of others in their present social setting.</p><p>Despite differing opinions, one thing is clear – Grande's voice has sparked quite a bit of confusion and conversation.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=ariana-grande-faced-issues-over-her-blaccent-claims-and-blackfishing-allegations>Ariana Grande Faced Issues Over Her Blaccent Claims And Blackfishing Allegations</h2><p>Ariana Grande has sparked discussions on TikTok due to a viral video showing her using different accents in various situations. Some viewers have accused her of using a "blaccent," which involves adopting characteristics of African-American Vernacular English. This has led to debates on social media about her accent choices and their appropriateness.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/ariana-grande-s-merch-is-one-of-the-main-reasons-she-s-absurdly-rich-for-her-age.jpg><p>In a video where she was named Billboard's Woman of the Year in 2018, Grande shared old baby photos and spoke with a heavy accent, which received mixed reactions from fans. Some found it cringe, while others expressed love for her but wished she would stop using the accent.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans' frustration stems from the perception that Ariana Grande adopts an inflection to sound like a black person, and some believe she acquired a New York accent during her relationship with ex-fiancé Pete Davidson.</p><p>This isn't the first time Grande has faced accusations of cultural appropriation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">She has been criticized for blackfishing</a>, changing her appearance and mannerisms to resemble a black woman. Her music video for "7 rings" drew criticism for appropriating elements of black culture as a costume.</p><p>Fans have pointed out that she also adopts aspects of other cultures, such as Japanese and Asian culture, depending on what boosts her image and profits.</p><p>Critics also argue that Ariana Grande incorporates elements from multiple cultures in the music video. The use of a trap house setting and imagery raised concerns initially, and further criticism emerged when she adopted a kawaii aesthetic, seen as an exploitation of Japanese and Asian culture, may be <a href=#>the reason why Grande actually lost money in "7 rings"</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Did Ariana Grande Ever Do More For Wolfee Donuts Aside From Apologize Before She Was Banned Forever?</a></span></p><p>Even her ex-fiancé, Pete Davidson, jokingly commented on her spray tan, "Can you imagine if I did that? My career would be over tomorrow. If I spray-painted myself brown and hopped on the cover of Vogue magazine and just started s***ting on my ex?" he shared via Insider.</p><p>Ariana Grande was born in Boca Raton, Florida, to parents of Italian descent, that's why critics insist that doesn't need to try to look like one of the black community people because she is white.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdmbymv4yaqaKZnpZ6qL7Ap5ueq12rvKqvxGainp2gYrCprc2goKefXZe5oq%2FCnqWtZZOhrqq50mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./15-things-that-would-happen-if-the-moon-disappeared-right-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>15 Things That Would Happen If The Moon Disappeared Right Now</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./what-happened-between-lindsay-lohan-and-netflix.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>What Happened Between Lindsay Lohan and Netflix?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
