Since then, Grint has been busy pursuing both tv and film projects (<a href=#>most recently, he starred in the Apple TV+ series Servant</a>). At the same time, Grint also took his talent to Broadway, much like his former co-star Daniel Radcliffe.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Dark Truth About Daniel Radcliffe's Performance In 'Harry Potter'</a></span></p><p>And while he may have been taking various roles these past few years, there’s also reason to believe that Grint may not stick around for much longer. In fact, fans have come to believe that the actor would soon walk away from acting for good.</p><h2 id=rupert-certainly-doesn-rsquo-t-need-to-work-for-money>Rupert Certainly Doesn’t Need To Work For Money</h2><p>Starring in eight Harry Potter films has certainly made Grint quite a fortune. In fact, estimates indicate that the actor earned anywhere between $50 and $70 million for his work on the franchise. And if anyone asks Grint himself, he also can’t say exactly how much he earned because he simply doesn’t know. “I actually don't know how much I have,” the actor revealed while speaking with Sky News. “I couldn't even really guess.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In recent years, <a href=#>Grint’s net worth has been estimated at around $50 million</a>. And with all the royalties he will continue to collect for Harry Potter, it’s safe to say that this number will keep going up in the years to come. That said, Grint has maintained that he doesn’t really care about how much he’s got. “It doesn't really motivate me too much. It makes you comfortable, that's the good thing about it, I think,” the actor said. “I'm glad it's there but I'm not really that focused on it.” And while acting seems to pay off handsomely for Grint, it turns out that the actor discovered other passions in recent years too.</p><h2 id=rupert-nearly-quit-acting-before>Rupert Nearly Quit Acting Before</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As it turns out, this isn’t the only time that Grint considered quitting acting. In fact, he almost walked away from it all after he finished working on the Harry Potter films. He never thought he’d make a living by being an actor in the first place. “When I started, [acting] was never something that I aspired to do. I did acting with school plays and stuff like that,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Grint told Entertainment Weekly</a>. “But it was never something that I actively dreamed of. I mean, I fell in love with it while I was doing it. But I definitely did think, ‘Is this really what I want to do?’”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Is Daniel Radcliffe Still Earning Money From 'Harry Potter' Now?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Once Harry Potter became a global hit, things got quite intense for Grint as he rose to superstardom. “You take for granted anonymity, just doing normal stuff, just going out,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the actor told Independent</a>. “Everything was different and a little bit scary. There were times when I was like ‘I’m done.’” At the same time, Grint also wished he could be more like others his age, which is impossible when projects keep on coming. “I wanted to live a little bit. I felt like I’d missed out on a lot,” he explained. “Being in that adult environment from such an early age, it was nice to just be away from it and not have any kind of commitments at all, and just be a bit free.”</p><h2 id=here-rsquo-s-why-he-may-quit-acting-altogether>Here’s Why He May Quit Acting Altogether</h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Especially with his accumulated wealth, Grint is, more or less, free to do whatever he wants. And in fact, that’s what he’s been up to recently, pursuing passions that don’t necessarily involve scripts and characters to portray. As it turns out, the actor has been busy building up his real estate portfolio recently, purchasing various residential properties that are mostly located in Hertfordshire. Meanwhile, the actor is also behind the company Oneonesix Development, which specializes in building large family homes.</p><p>For Grint, it’s not just real estate that’s got him thinking about leaving Hollywood for good. It’s also fatherhood. The Harry Potter star welcomed his first child (a daughter) with longtime partner Georgia Groome in 2020. For Grint, being a father has instantly made him a better person. “I feel like I’ve changed as a person for sure. It kind of happened overnight, lifestyle-wise. I stopped smoking straight away,” he told Glamour. “I’ve started sleeping so much better—I used to be a horrific insomniac, now I’m sleeping. It’s interesting, experiencing it all during a pandemic.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Alan Rickman Trends On Twitter, With Fans Believing He Deserved An Oscar For Every Role</a></span></p><p>At the same time, Grint said that becoming a father gave him an important realization about his Hollywood career. “I've always toyed with the idea of walking away from acting and becoming a dad has increased those feelings,” the actor told The Sunday Times Magazine. Instead, he’d rather try something different. “It would be nice to go off and do something completely different, like building or carpentry.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Beyond Servant, it remains unclear if Grint would be open to other Hollywood projects at the moment. Meanwhile, fans can relive Grint’s time on Harry Potter anytime as all eight films are now available on NBC’s streaming service, Peacock.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>This Harry Potter Star Nearly Starred In 'A Cinderella' Story Instead Of Chad Michael Murray</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiprqiVp8Fus9Gipa1lmJbAbr3UoqtmmZOptq%2BzjLCfmqxdna6xvMSnnJ1lpKR6qbXSZpqaqpWav3A%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./imad-bichri-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Imad Bichri Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ernie-reyes-jr-tmnt-actor-needs-kidney-transplant.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ernie Reyes Jr., TMNT Actor, Needs Kidney Transplant</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
