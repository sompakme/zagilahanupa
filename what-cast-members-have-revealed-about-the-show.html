Just when they were at their wit's end and starting to sweat, Caitriona Balfe came into the picture.

Balfe admits that it was an intense scene to shoot, but one that she drew excitement from, rather than nerves. This excitement is what helped propel her forward, through the chaos.</p><h2 id=richard-rankin-enjoyed-driving-the-crew-crazy-with-his-constant-singing><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Richard Rankin Enjoyed Driving The Crew Crazy With His Constant Singing</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/roger-rankin-singing-e1591810967254.jpg><p>Anyone who has seen interviews with Richard Rankin - who is indeed a skilled musician in real life - will have undoubtedly noted his contagious sense of humor. It's this same humor that kept him practicing his debut song&nbsp;on the set, despite pleas from the crew to stop.

Heughan had no hesitations when it came to running not one, but two, marathons while filming season four of the show, and he even beat his own personal best.</p><h2 id=the-famed-wedding-night-took-five-days-to-shoot><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>The Famed Wedding Night Took Five Days To Shoot</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-and-jamie-wedding-scene.jpg><p>Not every scene is one and done, especially not scenes that require a decent amount of intimacy and choreography, such as Jamie and Claire's wedding night. This scene alone, from start to finish, took five days, according to director Anna Foster. She shared this insight in an interview with&nbsp;Marie Claire.</p><h2 id=every-intimate-scene-is-strictly-choreographed-down-to-hair-movements><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Every Intimate Scene Is Strictly Choreographed, Down To Hair Movements</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/claire-and-jamie-mirror.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Not one thing is left to chance when it comes to perfecting these scenes. Everything the fans see has been choreographed down to each movement, no matter how small, so that it looks and feels as real as it can be. This results in longer filming times, but stunning scenes when it's all over.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Star Wars Cast Has Said About The Franchise</a></span></p><h2 id=tobias-menzies-slept-for-a-whopping-12-hours-straight-after-his-scene-at-culloden><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Tobias Menzies Slept For A Whopping 12-Hours Straight After His Scene At Culloden</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/randall-and-jamie.jpg><p>That's not to say Menzies isn't in shape! The Battle of Culloden was a rough scene for everyone, and from a fan's point of view, the cinematography is flawless. While both Menzies and Heughan had stunt doubles who were able to fill in if needed, they both chose to commit to the scene in a personal way, as there were many close-ups that weren't appropriate for doubles, anyway.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything The Game Of Thrones Cast Has Said About The Show</a></span></p><h2 id=sophie-skelton-studied-her-on-screen-parents-in-order-to-capture-a-realistic-likeness><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Sophie Skelton Studied Her On-Screen Parents In Order To Capture A Realistic Likeness</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/outlander-cast.jpg><p>When Sophie entered the picture, it was like watching a miniature, female version of Jamie come to life onscreen.

The scars look unbelievably realistic from the viewpoint of the fans, and the reason for that is the work (more than two hours!) that goes into creating them.
