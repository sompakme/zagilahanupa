Ye also falsely claimed earlier this month that George Floyd Floyd’s death was fentanyl-related even though Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of murdering Floyd by pinning down Floyd’s neck with his knee, per <a href=#><i>USA Today</i></a>.</p><p>“Throughout its history, Morehouse College, perhaps more than any other institution, has stood for social discourse which advances equity and healing, particularly in areas involving race, culture, and socio-economic disparities," the HBCU school said in a statement. “We therefore cannot condone, in perception or implication, the recent divisive and unproductive statements by Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.''</p><p>In a written statement, Morehouse spokesperson Cedric Mobley said: “Throughout its history, Morehouse College, perhaps more than any other institution, has stood for social discourse which advances equity and healing, particularly in areas involving race, culture, and socio-economic disparities.

In promoting the game, Ye’s Instagram post said: “Some establishments still stood up that’s love #lovespeech.” He also posted a link to purchase tickets, which ranged from $20 to $500, according to the site, according to the<a href=#><i> Atlanta Journal Constitution.</i></a></p><p>The online description of the event said it would be a chance to support the team at “a star studded night of hoops alongside Jaylen Brown and many other A-list celebs.”</p><p>On Twitter, Brown called the cancelation “an unfortunate retraction” and added that “the kids and family appreciate the consideration.” He wrote: “Currently looking for another solution.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On a campus with more than a half-dozen bungalows, there was no sign of students, teachers or members of the elite prep basketball team. Yet, unlike the school, the basketball team has yet to shut down – despite being disinvited last week by four tournaments during the ongoing fallout over West’s antisemitic comments.</p><p>About 15 minutes away, members of the basketball team were working out at Sports Academy, previously owned by Kobe Bryant and named Mamba Academy before Bryant’s death in 2020. But it's still unclear if and when the season will start for the Donda Doves.</p><p>A USA Today reporter on Monday was stopped at the front desk of the Sports Academy in Newbury Park, California.
