"Which I did, I took over Spin City when Michael J. Fox was too sick to work, but no one ever put those two together. … So, I should have been nicer."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He then acknowledged his faults, saying that his pride took over.
