As expected, the rapper, 43, delivered an at times incoherent speech and even had an emotional breakdown on stage.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>West made such ridiculous comments as “Harriet Tubman never actually freed the slaves, she just had them work for other white people” at the surprise rally held at the Exquis Event Center in North Charleston, where attendees were asked to sign a <a href=#>COVID-19 liability</a> waiver, social distance and wear a mask.</p><p>At one point, West, who talked about how <a href=#>Kim Kardashian West</a> almost had an abortion, started crying hysterically when he recalled that his father wanted his mom to terminate her pregnancy. To make matters worse, members of the audience heckled West, who had one person removed. In a video posted on Twitter, the rapper can be seen sobbing as he screams, “I almost killed my daughter.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Elon Musk, Kanye West, Joe Biden Twitter Accounts Hacked In Suspected Bitcoin Scam</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Although he eventually admitted that abortion should remain legal, he also suggested that each woman&nbsp;should receive $1 million when they have a baby. Meanwhile, he stated that marijuana should be free and discussed his own struggle with opioid addiction.</p><p>On Saturday, West teased the event on social media by asking supporters to submit signatures to get him on the ballot in the state. In his bid announcement, he said he was running for president to “realize the promise of America” with the hashtag #2020VISION. He reportedly got on the ballot in Oklahoma last week.</p><p>Some have wondered about West's mental state. Professor Jason Nichols, a senior lecturer in African American studies at the University of Maryland, told the BBC he suspected the rapper’s appearance may have been a "manic episode," though he stated that he was not a trained psychologist.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"He has admitted in the past he has been battling mental illness and that sometimes he does not take medication,” Nichols said. "He was a little more coherent than he has been in other times... when he has gone on these rants, but I really believe he is in a bad place right now. He said some really bizarre things."</p><p>To appear on the ballot in South Carolina, West needs to collect 10,000 signatures by noon local time (18:00 BST) on Monday.</p><p>Source: <a href=#>Hollywood Reporter</a></p><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Confusing Tweets From Kanye West We Are Still Trying To Figure Out</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmijkaPGpnnWnqqtZZikuaW%2FjJyYpqiRnrSvedGao6WxXZe%2Fpq3KrGSdp6ejeqS%2B2KKloGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./linda-powell-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-nationality-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Linda Powell Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Nationality, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-hudson-net-worth-know-about-her-husband-kids-and-boyfriend.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Hudson Net Worth: Know About Her Husband, Kids and Boyfriend</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
