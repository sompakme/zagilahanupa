Apparently, Kayla Nicole, Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend, was on the receiving end of attacks from Taylor Swift fans, who felt she had slammed Taylor's music.</p><p>While she's generally not that outspoken about her problems, it seems the online bashing got a little too much for the model, which is understandable, and she clapped back at swifties.</p><p><strong>"I’m unproblematic. Mind my business. Never respond to the constant vitriol. Solid as they come & don’t expect a pat on the back for it either," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she defended herself</a>.

Others accused her of playing the victim, and provoking swifties just to claim they bully her, but it honestly seems like a stretch, since Kayla was simply praising Beyonce's new album.</p><p>Travis and Kayla dated for five years, so of course she was an important person in his life, but it seems they parted on good terms, and <a href=#>Kayla still gets along with the Kelce family</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirq5mmnsBut8Slmp5lla16tLjApqpmq6ees7W1xKxkmqyklrCstc2gZKGdomKurbjEoJydpKlir6K%2Fx56bZqyRrrmwvoysrqKepGK6tr%2FInGY%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./2023-naacp-image-awards-nominees-announced-see-full-list.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>2023 NAACP Image Awards Nominees Announced: See Full List</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-wins-fails-of-the-2010-mtv-video-music-awards.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The WINs &amp;amp; FAILs Of The 2010 MTV Video Music Awards</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
