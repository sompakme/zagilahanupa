While early episodes appear like&nbsp;<i>Jury Duty</i>, helmed by <a href=#>Office</a>&nbsp;producers <strong>Lee Eisenberg</strong> and <strong>Gene Stupnitsky</strong>, is a reality TV show <a href=#>chronicling jury selection</a>, most of the cast are actually actors except for one participant, who is unaware that everything is fictionalized.</p><p class=p1>Gladden, for his part, is a contractor by trade, who <a href=#>answered a vague Craigslist ad</a> to participate in a documentary<a href=#> about jury duty</a>. Little did he know that his fellow jurors are all performers, including<a href=#> <strong>James Marsden</strong></a> as a sensationalized version of himself.</p><p class=p1>“We called him The Hero throughout the whole thing because we were creating a hero’s journey for somebody,” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>27 Dresses&nbsp;</i></a>actor, 49, recalled of Gladden&nbsp;during an April interview with <a href=#>IndieWire</a>. “If I saw any signs that he was tortured or that he was uncomfortable, I was ready to say, ‘I’m out. Pull the plug.’ And I was serious about it. I can’t sleep at night if I know that I’m making somebody, who doesn’t know that any of this is fake, uncomfortable in any way.”</p><p class=p1>He continued at the time: “The challenge for me was that I was a point person for Ronald. It <a href=#>was essential that I had his trust</a>, that we had good banter, that there was a friendship there. So, whenever I did something that he didn’t like or that he thought was really sh—ty behavior, I would then have to pull it back a bit and just be normal James to get back in his good graces. And then he would hopefully think, ‘OK. <a href=#>There’s a nice guy in there</a>, he just kind of got carried away in that moment.’”</p><p class=p1>While the&nbsp;<i>Jury Duty&nbsp;</i>cast — including Marsden and&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Sex Lives of College Girls</i>’ <strong>Mekki Leeper</strong></a> — had a rough script to follow, Gladden<a href=#> completely improvised his scenes</a> based on spur-of-the-moment reactions to the over-the-top situations.</p><p class=p1>“I was just under the impression that this was going to be a behind-the-scenes look … or what it was like for jury duty,” the construction worker recalled to&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Access Hollywood&nbsp;</i></a>in April. “So, I signed up for what I thought was a documentary. I didn’t really know what was going on until the end.”</p><p class=p1>Though Gladden was unaware that <a href=#>he was essentially being pranked</a> on the Freevee sitcom, Marsden gushed that his TV costar made “comedy gold” without trying.</p><p class=p1>“[Ronald was] like, ‘Do I recognize you? I didn’t know from what?’” the&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Westworld</i></a>&nbsp;alum recalled of the pair’s first&nbsp;<i>Jury Duty</i>&nbsp;scene during an April appearance on the <a href=#>“Chicks in the Office”</a> podcast. “And I was like, ‘Yeah, yeah, yeah, I’ve been in a lot of stuff’ and then I saw someone who was actually wearing socks that looked like it said ‘Sonic’ on it. Again, this is all just on the fly. … I’m just trying to think of a way in to talk about, you know, my stuff.”</p><p class=p1>Gladden, for his part, replied that he<a href=#> didn’t know Marsden was in&nbsp;<i>Sonic The Hedgehog </i></a>before retorting that he heard the 2020 film received bad reviews. “[It’s]&nbsp;comedy gold,” the&nbsp;<i>Hairspray&nbsp;</i>actor gushed on the podcast. “And then, I get to go, ‘Yeah, I mean a lot of people saw it, you should check it out, and then the next day he came in [and said], ‘Oh man, I’m sorry. I saw the movie last night. It was so great, you didn’t tell me <a href=#><strong>Ben Schwartz</strong></a> is in it!’”</p><p class=p1>Marsden added: “He was actually hitting moments that were scripted before we even got him there.”</p><p class=p1>Scroll below to find out where you’ve seen the cast of&nbsp;<i>Jury Duty&nbsp;</i>before:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Complete-Guide-to-James-Marsdens-Jury-Duty-Cast-4.jpg><h3 class=p1><b>James Marsden (Self)</b></h3><p class=p1>After a series of guest spots on various TV series, the Oklahoma native got his big break playing Scott Summers in 2000’s<i>&nbsp;X-Men</i>.
