As a child actress, we saw her in numerous different roles until she shot to fame after her stint on the Disney Channel. A lot of people grew up watching Bella do her thing and have become infatuated with her. That’s not just because she’s a pretty decent actress, but it’s also because she’s blossomed into a beautiful woman.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bella’s achieved a lot over the years. She’s received plenty of accolades, has been through highs, and has faced low moments too. It seems inconceivable that the woman we are discussing is&nbsp;only 20 years old! She’s wise beyond her years in terms of her experience and attitude, not to mention some of&nbsp;the photos she posts on Instagram.&nbsp;She looks around a decade older too. Bella is certainly all grown up. She’s had grown up relationships too. Her most notable relationship was with rapper Lil Peep. But Bella can cast her net far and wide. She isn’t just into guys. In 2016, Bella came out and revealed she is into men and women. She’d just split from her boyfriend and decided to post a Snapchat pic of herself kissing another girl. She knew it would create a stir, and later took to Twitter to confirm that she was indeed&nbsp;playing for both teams. That got people talking, and was one serious bit of juicy celebrity gossip. When something like that’s announced, you can’t help but start thinking about who Bella might be into. It opens up plenty of possibilities, and gets the rumor mill whirring. These are 15 female celebs that Bella Thorne fancies and may date next.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tana-mongeau-has-gotten-her-wish><strong>TANA MONGEAU HAS GOTTEN HER WISH</strong></h2><p>We know that Bella Thorne likes Tana Mongeau. They’ve been pictured doing a little more than just staring longingly into each other’s eyes. Bella Thorne’s perceived to be a wild child. But one benefit of that persona, from the media’s point of view, is that she’s very open. Her antics give everybody plenty to talk about. For example, when she released pics of herself locking lips with YouTube vlogger, Tana Mongeau, social media went into a frenzy.</p><p>In the past, Tana had said,&nbsp;“I want to date Bella Thorne.” Last year it seemed as if her dream came true. She let everyone know about it too. Bella left her inhibitions at the door when she got with her blonde bestie. They had their eyes on each other and chose to go all out and do something about it. Following those&nbsp;risqué&nbsp;images, there was even talk of the two being in a relationship. They’re probably not dating and are just having fun with each other. But there’s no doubt about it, Bella still has her eye on Tana.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-s-bestie-zendaya-could-be-something-more><strong>BELLA’S BESTIE ZENDAYA COULD BE SOMETHING MORE</strong></h2><p>Everyone, celebs or otherwise, needs someone they feel close to. Bella Thorne has no shortage of friends. Everywhere she goes she’s always got her posse in tow. But she’s got one friend who she’s seriously close to. That person is Zendaya. Ever since they starred together on Shake It Up, the&nbsp;two have been inseparable. The media has tried to separate them&nbsp;and tried to create controversy by pitting them against each other in beauty battles and making constant comparisons between the two. But their friendship’s remained strong. We know that Zendaya is someone Bella feels incredibly close to, and vice versa. It wouldn’t be the strangest thing if their relationship was to progress onto the next level. After all, people say the best romances are built on strong foundations&nbsp;of solid friendships. The two are very close and have gotten cozy and intimate with each other in the past. They’ve even locked lips. Who’s to say something else won’t happen down the line?</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-is-obsessed-with-dove-cameron><strong>BELLA IS OBSESSED WITH DOVE CAMERON</strong></h2><p>Over the years Bella Thorne hasn’t been shy about divulging all about her love for Dove Cameron. In fact, the term she uses to describe how she feels about Dove, is “obsession.” She’s regularly gushing in praise about Dove. Luckily for her, that feeling’s reciprocated. Dove’s another young 20-something, someone who’s worked with&nbsp;Bella in the past. They struck up a friendship – actually, a lot of people might say that their relationship has gone beyond just friendship. They’re always flirting with each other, and get seriously cheeky with one another. "She’s funny and she has this like beautiful angelic image and it’s just like ‘ah Dove.’ I really love her. " Bella has even said she wants to "wife her up." Bella came out as bi in 2016. Dove hasn’t come out as such but has done plenty to suggest that she too is more fluid than one might think. When she started favoriting Bella’s flirtatious social media posts, fans just went nuts. It’s no secret that they have their eyes on each other. It’s a very real possibility that something happens between the two. That’s a prospect a lot of people are bound to find awfully titillating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=kylie-jenner-s-life-might-get-even-more-complicated><strong>KYLIE JENNER’S LIFE MIGHT GET EVEN MORE COMPLICATED</strong></h2><p>Kylie Jenner has had a pretty hectic last few years. In fact, her life has been one big reality TV show. She was essentially brought up into that reality TV celebrity culture. She didn’t really have a choice but to follow in her sister’s footsteps and make the most of it. She has embraced that whole lifestyle and being the youngest sibling of the Kardashian-Jenner clan, has her own unique style and way of going about things. Someone who’s followed Kylie over the years has been Bella Thorne. They’re both the same age, and although they’re from different industries, they have each risen through different areas of the celebrity world&nbsp;and they’ve stuck up a friendship. Bella has said of Kylie, "I love Kylie, she's super sweet." Bella, being the wild girl that she is, has probably thought about Kylie is more than one way. The small fact that she’s just had a kid, and is with Travis Scott, probably wouldn’t perturb her if she wanted to make a go of things. Who knows, fireworks could ensue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-and-ariana-grande-are-both-disney-girls-who-love-a-good-time><strong>BELLA AND ARIANA GRANDE ARE BOTH DISNEY GIRLS WHO LOVE A GOOD TIME</strong></h2><p>A lot has been said in recent years regarding Bella Thorne and Ariana Grande’s relationship. There’s been nothing concrete, but there’s been a lot of speculation and rumors brought up by the media. Basically, it’s been said that Bella is regarded to be the mean girl of the current crop of young female superstars. There’s been talks of cliques forming, with the likes of Miley and Ariana in one, and Bella out there on her own. But Ariana and Bella have been pictured together in the past. They seem to have fun with each other and respect each other’s work. Now that we know that Bella has her eye on women as well as men, we can assume that Ariana might be in her line of sight. After all, who doesn’t – or hasn’t at one point – had a crush or fallen in deep for Ariana Grande? You can just envisage the two together.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-s-close-with-fellow-disney-girl-debby-ryan><strong>BELLA’S CLOSE WITH FELLOW DISNEY GIRL DEBBY RYAN</strong></h2><p>It’s no wonder these Disney girls have remained close. They’ve pretty much grown up on the Disney Channel together, have achieved the same level of fame, and their careers have followed similar paths. That could have had one of two outcomes: it could have resulted in them becoming rivals and hating each other, or it could have brought them close. Debby and Bella belong in the latter category. They’re not besties, but they’re still pretty&nbsp;good&nbsp; friends. They’ve worked on some of the same projects together, have frequently been pictured together. When Bella came out, plenty of people started suggesting names to her – as if she didn’t have anyone in mind already – as to who she should date. Debby Ryan was one of the more popular names to keep popping up. But Debby’s name didn’t really need to be suggested. Judging by the way they are with each other, it’s fair to assume Bella’s had her eye on Debby already.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-tale-of-the-two-bellas><strong>A TALE OF THE TWO BELLAS</strong></h2><p>Bella Pendergast isn’t exactly the most well-known name on this list. Some may say that she’s not even a celebrity. But nowadays people can achieve celebrity status for doing pretty much anything,&nbsp;such as dating celebs, or being seen out with them. That’s how Bella Pendergast has become something of a celebrity. She’s become something of an internet sensation over recent years. That’s because of her antics with the Thorne family. Bella P and Bella T have been besties for the longest time. Bella P was actually dating Bella T’s brother at one point. But that’s not what made her famous. What propelled her into the limelight was when she was seen locking lips with her best friend. They’ve certainly taken their relationship to the next level. Bella T’s said Bella P’s her soulmate. She’s going to be in Bella T’s life for some time, and it probably won’t be the last you hear of her.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=victoria-justice-and-bella-could-become-more-than-friends><strong>VICTORIA JUSTICE AND BELLA COULD BECOME MORE THAN FRIENDS</strong></h2><p>Victoria Justice is another celeb whose career has been pretty similar to Bella’s. Both became teenage idols and have since grown, gone on to the next level. Most celebs who grew up on TV have found the whole celebrity lifestyle hard to handle, have gone wild&nbsp;and gone off the rails somewhat, Bella included. But Victoria Justice is one of only a few who has got her head screwed on right. She’s behaved like the model celebrity right throughout her career, has remained grounded, and that’s something that’s held her in good stead. She’s also incredibly beautiful. She’s certainly Bella’s type of girl. The two have done things together over the years and are always smiling when around one another. It wouldn’t be the strangest thing if Bella Thorne had her eye on Victoria. That relationship might actually be good for Bella; Victoria could help her simmer down, which may stop her going off the rails.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=we-know-that-bella-thorne-has-her-eye-on-kristen-stewart><strong>WE KNOW THAT BELLA THORNE HAS HER EYE ON KRISTEN STEWART</strong></h2><p>Bella Thorne is pretty open when it comes to divulging juicy bits of gossip to the media. Her revealing that she was bi was pretty juicy in itself. But then people began to speculate about who Bella would have her eye on. She didn’t make us wait long to find out. Bella Thorne’s actually never&nbsp;seriously dated a girl. Sure, she seems to like to experiment. But in terms of actually dating a girl, she hasn’t yet gone down that road. She’s said she’s still confused when it comes to dating members of the same gender. She has a hard time distinguishing between friendship, flirting and something more. But If she was to date a girl, that girl would be Kristen Stewart. Bella’s said as much: “She’s so hot. She seems like the raddest chick. I'd be so down.” She’s someone who’s probably crossing her fingers, hoping that Kristen’s relationship with Stella Maxwell doesn’t work out!</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=many-think-bella-and-miley-would-be-a-match-made-in-heaven><strong>MANY THINK BELLA AND MILEY WOULD BE A MATCH MADE IN HEAVEN</strong></h2><p>When Miley Cyrus graduated from Disney TV, it’s as if a switch was flipped. Her personality suddenly came out; she became this seriously risqué&nbsp;singing superstar, part of the young wild crew of girls who’ve risen up through the ranks. Bella’s not quite on Miley’s level, but she’s certainly heading down that road.</p><p>There’s been speculation in recent years that Miley and Bella actually don’t get on. Sections of the media have created controversy in suggesting that the two aren’t exactly fans of each other and are part of separate cliques. We haven’t seen anything to suggest that. In fact, judging from their interactions with one another over the years, the two seem quite friendly. Bella’s even said that Miley Cyrus is one of her biggest crushes. We therefore know she has her eye on her. Miley&nbsp;is currently engaged to Liam Hemsworth, but is actually bi, although she doesn’t like that term. She doesn’t like to be put in that category. So, who knows, something could yet happen between the two in the future.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-is-crushing-hard-on-demi-lovato><strong>BELLA IS CRUSHING HARD ON DEMI LOVATO</strong></h2><p>Demi Lovato has had a seriously tough time over the years. She’s another young, troubled superstar, someone who’s needed a lot of help to get her life in order, stay on the right track. It’s a miracle that she is still around,&nbsp;and fighting fit in the limelight. Demi’s dealt with bullying, has suffered from depression, various other mental health disorders, has struggled with self-harm, and has had stints in rehab. Someone who’d want to put a comforting arm around her is Bella Thorne. Due to her lifestyle, Bella might not be the best person to do so. But still, we know that Demi is in Bella’s sights. That’s because she’s revealed that her number one celebrity crush is Demi Lovato. Demi’s another woman who’s come out as being into both men and women. Bella seems to be picking all the right women! Her feelings could be reciprocated.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cara-delevingne-is-perfectly-suited-to-bella><strong>CARA DELEVINGNE&nbsp;IS PERFECTLY SUITED TO BELLA</strong></h2><p>Cara Delevingne is another wild and slightly wacky woman that Bella’s sure to have her eyes on. Most of those in the celeb world who’ve revealed they’re down with same-gender&nbsp;relationships have had their eyes on Cara. She’s just that type of woman. She doesn’t seem to take herself too seriously, and has a very relaxed persona. But she also leads that wild, partying lifestyle that many other celebs have fallen prey too. Cara’s just embracing the celebrity lifestyle, and is loving her status and fame. Bella’s something of the same character. Although they haven’t really been hanging together over the years, that doesn’t mean Cara wouldn’t be perfectly suited to Bella. Their paths haven’t really crossed, but that doesn’t mean Bella doesn’t have her eye on Cara. Cara’s another woman who’s open about her feelings for women. She actually has experience dating girls. Bella must be hoping that she could use some of this experience.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=selena-gomez-is-another-disney-star-bella-s-close-with><strong>SELENA GOMEZ IS ANOTHER DISNEY STAR BELLA’S&nbsp;CLOSE WITH</strong></h2><p>Selena Gomez is arguably one of the biggest female stars in the celeb world at the moment. Although her health problems have slowed her down, she’s generally been excelling in both the acting and music professions. She’s a born performer who is made for living life in the limelight.</p><p>Rumors have been making the rounds over the years that Bella and Selena aren’t on good terms. From what we’ve seen over the years, the&nbsp;two are quite pally with each other. They’ve been pictured together pretty regularly over the years. They have worked on the same projects, and have been seen together at the same events. Most recently, they were spotted embracing each other at the March For Our Lives protest in Los Angeles.</p><p>Selena’s always been known for her on-again off-again relationship with Justin Bieber. But although she’s been pretty sketchy about the details, Selena has dropped hints that she’s not so closed off to the idea of dating women. She has questioned her romantic preferences. It seems like Bella wouldn’t mind helping her know once and for all.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=sofia-richie-and-bella-thorne-have-an-interesting-relationship><strong>SOFIA RICHIE AND BELLA THORNE HAVE AN INTERESTING RELATIONSHIP</strong></h2><p>We wouldn’t go as far to say that Bella Thorne and Sofia Richie are enemies. Neither are they best buddies. But they’ve mixed in the same circles, have had to deal with the same bit of controversy. This controversy stems from Sofia dating Scott Disick. Scott isn’t a guy who’s got the best reputation. Although nothing’s been proven, Scott’s allegedly betrayed Kourtney in the past. It wouldn’t surprise many people if he’d done that to Sofia. That’s what everyone thought once upon a time. Scott’s been pictured with Bella numerous times since he broke up Kourtney. But Bella doesn’t have very nice things to say about him, and isn’t a fan of him at all. People have thought she’s been trying to muscle in on Sofia and Scott’s relationship. Some people have other ideas. Some feel she wants to get close to Sofia, not to Scott. That would make more sense. Think about it for a sec. Sofia is more Bella’s type.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=bella-thorne-is-heading-down-lindsay-lohan-lane><strong>BELLA THORNE IS HEADING DOWN LINDSAY LOHAN LANE</strong></h2><p>What?! A lot of you have probably read this title and are incredulously shaking your heads. Bella Thorne is a woman who’s certainly out there, is loud, bolshie, and loves to let her hair down. But to say that she’s heading down the same destructive path that Lindsay Lohan spent a lot of time down may be going a bit too far. But that’s what large sections of the media have been saying based on Bella’s attitude, some of her antics to date. Both have had a similar start to their careers and have taken a wrong turn. It’s not too late for Bella to do a U-turn. Many people think that they’re similar in terms of their personalities, very much like each other. Perhaps Bella’s heading down Lindsay Lohan lane in the hope of bumping into Lindsay. It wouldn’t be the craziest bit of news. After all, Lindsay has had romantic relationships with women in the past. People say that opposites attract, that likeminded individuals clash. Perhaps they could be compatible, strike up something special. We’ll have to wait and see if anything materializes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpaGWmsC1xcueqmhpZWKzprnApZxmm5WhsqO%2FjK2fmqxdl7KtuMBmq6GnoqOybq%2FOrqOdZZekeqe70WalnrCkZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./23-favorite-tracy-jordan-moments-on-30-rock.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>23 Favorite Tracy Jordan Moments on 30 Rock</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./top-entrepreneur-books-for-beginners-in-2024.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top Entrepreneur Books for Beginners in 2024</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
