Liliane Bettencourt was a businesswoman, she also owned about 21% of Nestle shares and was once the richest woman in Europe as well.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=a-rising-star-francoise-and-l-oreal>A Rising Star: Francoise And L’Oreal</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Francoise-Bettencourt-Meyers.png> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>In 1997, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers made her way into the L’Oreal board as a director. This was easy seeing that her grandfather owned L’Oreal and her mother was a major shareholder already. In 2007, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers <a href=#>filed a lawsuit insinuating</a> that her mother was mentally impaired due to the “The Bettencourt Affairs”. This was after she believed Francois Marie Bannier took advantage of her mother’s dementia and was trying to take over her inheritance. This made the court place the family’s assets under her guidance and that of her two sons.&nbsp;However, on the death of her mother in September 2017, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers began to play much larger roles in L’Oreal as her mother’s fortune was passed down to her, and then she also became the chairwoman of Tethys Invest, <a href=#>the family company</a> that owns L’Oreal.&nbsp;In September 2017, Liliane Bettencourt her mother, the sole heiress of L’Oreal and one of the major shareholders in Nestle died at the age of 94, leaving behind her massive fortune of about $46 billion to her daughter Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers. According to French law, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers must have also inherited a minimum of 50% of her mother’s real estate assets.&nbsp;This skyrocketed Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers’s net worth and increased her assets as part of the <a href=#>real estate assets she inherited</a> including a state-of-the-art decor-styling mansion in the wealthy suburbs of Neuilly-sur-Seine in Paris, France, and another mansion she grew up in which is close to the Brittany Coast.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>The African Giant: A Look At Burna Boy's Insane Music Career</a></span></p><h2 id=shares-and-investments>Shares And Investments</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Francoise-Bettencourt-Meyers.png> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers currently holds the largest amount of shares in L’Oreal which owns Lancôme and Garnier brands. Her shares in L’Oreal are estimated to be about 33.1%, this amounts to a whooping value of $107.5 billion and despite the 2020 pandemic, still raked in at least <a href=#>$38.2 billion in revenue</a> in 2021. There have been speculations of her family company, Tethys Invest investing in hospital groups later but currently, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers is the chairwoman of Tethys Investments which she founded alongside her family in 2016.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=books-the-greek-gods-and-other-ventures>Books: The Greek Gods And Other Ventures</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.therichestimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Francoise-Bettencourt-Meyers.png> Via Wikimedia Commons<p>Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers didn’t only have a successful business career but she also became a successful <a href=#>writer and a published author</a>.

Her book The Greek Gods&nbsp;won the Prix Des Lauriers Verts.&nbsp;Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers runs a philanthropic organization that was founded by her family. The organization caters to initiatives in science and art within France and in 2019, in conjunction with L’Oreal, Francoise Bettencourt-Meyers and her family decided to give out $229 million for renovations of <a href=#>the Notre Dame Cathedral</a> in Paris after it was ravaged by a fire that same year.&nbsp;During the 2020 pandemic, her family and L’Oreal donated about $25 million and also helped produce free hand sanitizers for the pandemic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>READ NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Here's What Happened To Michael Jackson's Estate After His Death</a></span></p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Forbes</a>&nbsp;and <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGS%2Fqq%2FHnqqtZaekuqK6jKKlZp2lp7yxsYyhnKudo2K1sMOMn6mappOktrSxjJucrayVo7CwwdGtZKadqZq%2FtHnMmpueZZiav26DlGZqZpqZobmqu81mm6iknJa%2FbrLOq6uuppVk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./t-i-s-sister-precious-harris-dies-at-66-after-car-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>T.I.s Sister Precious Harris Dies at 66 After Car Accident</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./paramount-takes-over-grease-prequel-series.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Paramount+ Takes Over Grease Prequel Series</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
