As <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>’s romance with <a href=#><strong>Pete Davidson</strong></a> heated up, her estranged husband, <a href=#><strong>Kanye West</strong></a>, <a href=#>attacked his ex’s relationship on social media and in song</a>.</p><p class=p2>The Yeezy designer made headlines in February 2022, claiming <a href=#>his&nbsp;<i>Donda 2&nbsp;</i>partnership with <strong>Kid Cudi</strong> had been terminated</a> over the Ohio native’s friendship with the <i><a href=#>Saturday Night Live</a>&nbsp;</i>star.</p><p class=p2>“Just <a href=#>so everyone knows Cudi will not be on&nbsp;Donda&nbsp;</a>because he’s friends with you know who,” West wrote on lined paper, which he then shared via&nbsp;Instagram in a now-deleted post. “We all speak in&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Billie [Eilish]</strong></a>&nbsp;language now.”</p><p class=p2>Cudi, for his part, replied: “Too bad I don’t wanna be on ur album u f—in dinosaur hahaha. Everyone knows I’ve been the best thing about ur albums since I met u. Ima pray for u brother.”</p><p class=p2>West later <a href=#>doubled down on the pair’s beef</a> when he shared a series of lengthy Instagram disses one day later, even alleging that Davidson — who began dating the Skims mogul in late 2021 — is unable to meet <a href=#>his four children with Kardashian</a>: <a href=#>North, Saint, Chicago, and Psalm</a>.</p><p class=p2>“NO YOU WILL NEVER MEET MY CHILDREN,” the Illinois native wrote via<a href=#> Instagram</a> one day after his post slamming Kid Cudi, sharing what appeared to be a text message exchange with the&nbsp;<i>Guy Code&nbsp;</i>alum.</p><p class=p2>Davidson allegedly wrote via text: “As a man, I’d never get [in the] way of your children. That’s a promise. How you guys [go about] raising your kids is your [business] and not mine. I do hope [one] day I can meet them and we [can] all be friends.”</p><p class=p2>While neither Davidson nor Kardashian immediately addressed the record producer’s claims, West alleged his account <a href=#>had not been “hacked” nor did anyone else post the recent allegations</a> on his feed.</p><p class=p2>“MY ACCOUNT IS NOT HACKED,” West wrote via <a href=#>Instagram</a> shortly after sharing the text message screenshot, alongside a snap of himself holding up a piece of paper with the date. “I <a href=#>WILL BE AT SUNDAY SERVICE AT NOON</a> AND WILL [be] <a href=#>TAKING NORTH AND SAINT TO THE SUPERBOWL</a> SHORTLY AFTER. [<a href=#><strong>Michael Che</strong></a>] I’LL DOUBLE WHATEVER THEY PAYING YOU JUST SO YOU DONT HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT PAWN EVER AGAIN BIG LOVE.”</p><p class=p2>The&nbsp;<i>Big Time Adolescence&nbsp;</i>star and the&nbsp;<i>Selfish&nbsp;</i>author <a href=#>were first linked in October 2021</a>, weeks after <a href=#>connecting on the set of </a><i><a href=#>SNL</a>.</i></p><p class=p2>“Kim and Pete are getting serious. Things have definitely escalated quickly but in a healthy, fun way,” an <a href=#>insider exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>in December 2021</a>. “Right now, they are just enjoying their time together and seeing where things go.”</p><p class=p2>Ahead of Kardashian’s new romance, she <a href=#>filed for divorce from West in February 2021</a> after nearly seven years of marriage. Though she’s moved on, Kardashian hoped the pair <a href=#>could amicably coparent</a> their four children, even referring to herself as <a href=#>West’s “biggest cheerleader” in <i>Vogue</i>’s March 2022 cover story</a>.</p><p class=p2>“You could be so hurt or angry at your ex, but I<a href=#> think in front of the kids, it always has to be ‘Your dad’s the best.’</a> … No matter what you’re personally going through,” the KKW Beauty entrepreneur said at the time. “For so long, I did what made other people happy and I think in the last two years I decided, I’m going to make myself happy. And that feels really good. … I think it’s important to be honest with yourself about what really makes you happy. I’ve chosen myself. I think it’s OK to choose you.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p2>The “Heartless” performer — who <a href=#>was since linked</a> to <a href=#><strong>Julia Fox</strong></a> — has <a href=#>continued to allege that he wanted his family back together</a>.
