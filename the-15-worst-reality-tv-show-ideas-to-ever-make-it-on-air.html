Many even share guilty pleasures through some of the shows. They hate the fact that they love that particular series. But you can’t help it that they are so good and entertaining. Sometimes it’s because unfortunately, we can relate to what’s going on and sometimes it’s just fun to watch.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, not all reality TV shows get away with being guilty pleasures. When something becomes so popular, especially in the entertainment industry, producers and directors can’t hold back on partaking on the trend as well. But sometimes they forget to make the show actually good and they just throw ideas out there hoping for the same success other reality TV shows have had.</p><p>It’s already exhausting enough to watch a preview of yet another reality TV show, but it’s even worse when the story-line is just not in the cards. We began to think how in the world did this show make it on-screen and not my school film project? These crazy reality TV show ideas are the perfect example of quality versus quantity. It’s best, or less worse, to have a few good reality TV shows than have a bunch of awful television take over every hour on our screens.</p><p>Take a look at these 15 worst reality TV show ideas ever to make it on air.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=15-the-real-world-ex-plosion---mtv><strong>15. The Real World Ex-Plosion - MTV</strong></h2><p>You know a show is suffering when the producers decide to do spin-offs and they are even worse than the original show. Take MTV’s long-running reality show, The Real World. The series is a perfect example of a show losing its popularity and needs a lifesaver quick. The directors and producers of this show have been trying so hard for years to recover the Real World by creating these spin-off shows that just lack so much creativity, it hurts. The Real World Ex-Plosion probably tops all of them, though. The series follows not only a group of diverse strangers but also their exes. Sounds juicy right? Well, audience members weren't really that impressed with the idea. In order to boost ratings even more, the show’s format was even changed to introduce an even more realistic picture for the viewers. But as we all know, reality TV is getting even more artificial so nothing could have really proved how real the show actually was.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=14-are-you-hot---abc><strong>14. Are You Hot? - ABC</strong></h2><p>Yet another superficial reality TV show that some producers thought would grab the attention of the audience right away, especially with the catchy title. In 2003, ABC decided to throw us the show, Are You Hot? The Search for America’s Sexiest People, that would focus on finding the sexiest people in America…and that’s it. Yes being attractive does get you somewhere but not all the time. Thank god America didn’t let this show continue to air after finding out their first season’s out of this world low ratings. The contestants probably thought this was their chance to let their sexiness shine but it really turned out to be quite the opposite. At least now we know that being hot and attractive isn’t always a good thing and there’s a chance of rejection.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=13-bridalplasty---e><strong>13. Bridalplasty - E!</strong></h2><p>The E! reality TV show followed 12 engaged women, or already married, who were in the middle of competing for the wedding of their dreams along with the surgery of their dreams. That’s right, you read that correctly. The women would first compete for one of their dream surgeries and who ever won that week, got to have their procedure done. At the end of the show, one winner would be chosen who would get their desired surgery procedure and their dream wedding. So where’s the husband in all of this? Well, he would show up at the end of the show with his soon-to-be wife to be dressed in her wedding dress. The thing was would she even look like the same lady he fell in love with? The reviews on the show were just what you expected it to be and E! unquestionably cancelled the show after its first season in 2010.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=12-who-wants-to-marry-a-multi-millionaire---fox><strong>12.&nbsp;Who Wants to Marry a Multi-Millionaire? - FOX</strong></h2><p>Sure the title seems catchy. Plus, everyone wants to know which girl will shamelessly walk away marrying a multi-millionaire but things got a little more heavy than the storyline after discovering some unpleasant news. The show follows a couple of women competing for the love of Rick Rockwell, who is asked to show up after the competition. He then chose Darva Conger to marry him in the end but things escalated quickly after finding out Rockwell’s real name was actually Richard Balkey and he had a restraining order against him for domestic violence. Conger got what she asked for from the beginning, an annulment, and FOX decided to cancel the show even though it had 22 million viewers tuning in to the special. Perhaps, FOX didn’t do a good job at researching beforehand and can take this as a lesson for their future shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=11-i-know-my-kid-s-a-star---vh1><strong>11. &nbsp;I Know My Kid’s A Star - VH1</strong></h2><p>Just after one season in 2008, the reality TV series, hosted by <a href=#><strong>Danny Bonaduce</strong></a>, was cancelled. The show followed ten parents and their children competing with each other to see which child would make it in the Hollywood Business. The winner would take $50,000 in cash and get a year of representation by one of the industry’s top managers, Marki Costello, who was also one of the judges. You would think the kids would be the ones playing and fighting with each other while the parents are the cordial, mature adults trying to be the mediators. Well it was the complete opposite of that. Parents were always seen fighting with each other and getting nasty which was entertaining for a little while until we came to our senses. Although, they were just being parents fighting for their children, the VH1 TV series wasn’t a pleasure to watch.</p><h2 id=10-i-want-a-famous-face---mtv><strong>10.&nbsp;I Want a Famous Face - MTV</strong></h2><p>Aside from The Real World and other reality TV shows, MTV decided to pursue the plastic surgery route. The short-lived reality TV show, I Want a Famous Face, premiered on March 15 2004 and only lasted one season with 12 episodes. It ended on June 7, 2005. The show featured a few young adults who go through plastic surgery to accomplish the celebrity face of their dreams but it would also showcase some of the bad aftermath of the surgery. A couple of famous faces wanted were not that surprising with the likes of <a href=#><strong>Britney Spears</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Pamela Anderson</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Brad Pitt</strong> </a>and <a href=#><strong>Ricky Martin</strong></a>. Although the show premiered in the middle of when plastic surgery was getting a lot more buzz than before, the show just didn’t hit the mark with the audience of MTV. Interestingly enough though, when <a href=#><strong>Drew Barrymore</strong></a> discovered the show and found out that a 23-year-old girl wanted to have cosmetic surgery to look like her, the actress decided to contact her directly and convinced her to not have the surgery. The girl ended up not doing it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=9-survival-of-the-richest---wb><strong>9. Survival of the Richest - WB</strong></h2><p>The reality TV show, Survival of the Richest, premiered on March 31, 2006 on the WB Television Network. The show would showcase a group of wealthy contestants who would ultimately compete for a cash prize. However, there was a catch. There were seven kids who were worth over $3 billion but weren’t competing on their own. Instead, they were paired up with other kids who carried a combined debt of $150,000. Hosted by<a href=#><strong> Hal Sparks</strong></a>, the kids would compete with each other for the grand prize of $200,000 through a number of challenges. Sounds interesting but the show got some mixed reviews mainly because of the stereotypes of the rich and poor. In the end, the WB reality TV show was unfortunately cancelled due to low ratings and a change in the networks.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=8-living-lohan---e><strong>8.&nbsp;Living Lohan - E!</strong></h2><p>With E! and the name “Lohan,” you would think this reality TV show would be a hit. But in reality, it wasn’t. The audience was eager to watch controversial celebrity, <strong><a href=#>Lindsay Lohan</a>,</strong> and what she was all about especially after everything she went through. But viewers were quick to jump on the fact that her mother, <a href=#><strong>Dina Lohan</strong></a>, was portrayed as the villain on the show, where she exposed her other daughter, <a href=#><strong>Ali Lohan</strong></a>, and the rest is history. We didn’t really catch a glimpse of the 30-year-old actress which was what the audience was waiting for. Instead, the show captured some unpleasant scenes that even <a href=#><strong>Anderson Cooper</strong></a> had enough. “I cannot believe I’m wasting a minute of my life watching these horrific people,” he said. E! went through one season of the show but cancelled it after that first season. Dina insisted another network was working on picking up the reality TV series, but nothing ever happened.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=7-summer-house---bravo-tv><strong>7. Summer House - Bravo TV</strong></h2><p>The summer party inspired reality TV show just premiered on the Bravo network last Monday, January 16th, right after the other party-drinking-inspired show, Vanderpump Rules. The show is really just about a group of good-looking, young and rich people partying it up in the popular beach location of the Hamptons. Yeah, sounds like every other reality TV show ever created after the Real World first came up with the idea. If you’re a fan of Vanderpump Rules and keep up with every episode, then you might have caught two of the Summer House cast members, <a href=#><strong>Lauren Wirkus</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Ashley Wirkus</strong> </a>make an appearance on the show along with <a href=#><strong>Stassi Schroeder</strong></a>. On the show, the three blondes are seen as friends at first but we’re pretty sure as soon as you saw the preview during the commercials with those same twin sisters, you probably thought something’s iffy. Overall, this whole show is not only the most typical idea, but it comes off as such a setup, considering some of the cast members happened to appear on one of Bravo TV’s shows as if it was some sort of publicity stunt. Surprised? Not really.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=6-bromance-with-brody-jenner><strong>6.&nbsp;Bromance with&nbsp;Brody Jenner</strong></h2><p>Brody Jenner seems to keep searching for his big break but nothing ever comes through for the long-time reality TV star. Some of us might know him as the son of <a href=#><strong>Bruce Jenner</strong></a>, now known as Caitlyn Jenner, others might have seen him on Keeping Up With The Kardashians a few times because of Jenner, and the rest remember his on and off fling with <a href=#><strong>Lauren Conrad</strong> </a>on MTV’s The Hills. But none of that was enough for the now DJ that he decided to see how popular he really was which in turn, not that much. The show Bromance with Brody Jenner premiered on MTV, following a group of eight guys who were competing to be the new best friend of Jenner. Sounds really awkward and weird. If anything, we’ll give it to MTV for not doing another boring dating competition but instead go with all guys. Still, the show was cancelled after poor ratings.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=5-pretty-wild><strong>5. Pretty Wild</strong></h2><p>In an effort to recreate the Kardashians all over again but with a brand new group of non-traditional, rich spoiled sisters, E! premiered Pretty Wild back in 2010 which only ran for one season. The reality TV show was about these three socialite sisters, who were trying to make it in Hollywood but had everything else going for them including their mom who handled all parts of the business. Sounds super, ridiculously familiar? However, one of the sisters gave the show a little twist that gave the audience at least one reason to watch it. <a href=#><strong>Alexis Neiers</strong></a> happened to be involved in the controversial group “Bling Ring” who were known for breaking into houses of celebrities including <a href=#><strong>Paris Hilton</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Orlando Bloom</strong></a>, and <a href=#><strong>Rachel Bilson</strong></a>. When the show premiered, it captured the trial of Neiers where she pleaded no contest to felony burglary and was sentenced to six months in jail in Los Angeles. That’s as interesting as the show gets, considering it was just another version of the Kardashians which E! thought would give them double the success.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=4-the-world-according-to-paris---oxygen><strong>4.&nbsp;The World According to Paris - Oxygen</strong></h2><p>Just like with Living Lohan, the title of this reality TV show was pretty eye catching, considering the name of Paris Hilton. The show premiered in 2010, back when Paris was the it-girl - yes before her ex-best friend <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a> took over the world of pop culture. If you can recall, Paris was already in another reality show called the Simple Life alongside bff, <a href=#><strong>Nicole Richie</strong></a>. That show was a hit and pretty fun to watch but when Oxygen decided to give us a bit more of Hilton, the audience was like no thanks. The spin off followed the wealthy celebrity through her daily life, her court-ordered community service and her epic birthday celebration. However, no one could find the interest in watching more of Paris Hilton when we already had enough of her in the media. The show only scored about 290,000 viewers, becoming the lowest rated TV show for the Oxygen Network.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=3-famously-single---e><strong>3.&nbsp;Famously Single -&nbsp; E!</strong></h2><p>The show is just as annoying as the title sounds. Like who cares? The E! reality TV show premiered in the summer of 2016 which followed eight single celebrities who were ready to mingle and find love. What was actually entertaining about the series is we all got to watch the obvious reasons why these people are single and on a reality show to find love. It was pretty embarrassing for these celebrities but nonetheless, laughable for the rest of us. The show includes some well-known reality TV cast members (surprise) such as <a href=#><strong>Brandy Glanville</strong></a> from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, <a href=#><strong>Pauly D</strong></a> from Jersey Shore and <a href=#><strong>Aubrey O’Day</strong></a> who appeared on MTV’s Making The Band with<a href=#><strong> P-Diddy</strong></a> along with other reality TV shows. Later in 2006, it was announced that the show was actually coming back for a second season in 2017 and people just asked why. Guess E! has a way of making things happen when it comes to reality TV.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=2-britney-and-kevin-chaotic---upn><strong>2.&nbsp;Britney and Kevin: Chaotic - UPN</strong></h2><p>It seems as if just because a show has a couple of celebrities in it, doesn’t mean it’s going to be automatically successful. Producers need to realize this and stop lacking creativity. That’s what happened when a group of people in a room decided it would be a good idea to have a show about just <strong>Britney Spears</strong> and her ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Kevin Federline</strong></a>, titled Britney and Kevin: Chaotic. The series was a little too much for people to handle after watching a couple of home videos of the two making love and boasting about how great it was. They were already seen with a bad reputation in the media so who thought it would be a good idea to create a whole show on their messy lifestyle? This was during Britney’s hectic transition in life so again, who thought it was a good idea to make a show about it? With five episodes and nearly two million viewers tuned in, the show was cancelled just before the network UPN shut down.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=1-rob-and-chyna---e><strong>1. Rob and Chyna - E!</strong></h2><p>As if Keeping Up With The Kardashians wasn’t enough, the oh so popular E! Network, known for their love of reality TV shows, decided to spoil us even more with the family and hope to reach as much success as the original KUWTK series. But when the show premiered last September, people couldn’t exactly keep up with the show as it was so dry and boring with nothing new to offer. With the couple’s popularity on social media, the show seemed to be another way of showcasing their non-traditional lifestyle which we already saw play out online. Not only are their lives already out there for us to judge, but things seemed to be coming out as a set-up as opposed to reality. Once again, we are not surprised but it sure is tiring to see the same thing play out over and over again. The E! Network should just give up on all these KUWTK spin off shows, and just stay with the original because we have a feeling that one’s never going away.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Source:&nbsp;huffingtonpost.com</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmsKeiobFusc2tnKuskZ67rrHNrWatoJVifnZ51qiprKxdp7KiuMitsGaspmLAqbvWZqCdnZGoerW7jJ6tnqpdoq6ssYyiq2annmKuqr6O</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-aaron-wheelz-fotheringham-wife-charlee-wilson-fotheringham-meet-the-family-of-agt-contestant.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Aaron Wheelz Fotheringham Wife Charlee Wilson Fotheringham?
