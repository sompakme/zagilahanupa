By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game?

Not only is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Taylor living at Travis’ $6 million Kansas mansion</a> in between tour stops and other obligations, but he’s also apparently gearing up to propose to her. One <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">report claims it could happen over Christmas</a>.</p><p>Taylor broke up with Joe Alwyn after six years together at the start of 2023, amid reports that his hesitation to get married played a part. If the rumors are true, perhaps Taylor will get the engagement she wants with Travis, possibly even before the end of the year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1llJq7qrHSZqmepJGptrC60qGgqWWgp7yjuMSmqmasopbDqr%2BMm6mam5WhsrV5x55krKOZpcBursirq6Gcka58</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./tripadvisor-names-uptown-luxury-hotel-the-ivey-s-among-best-in-us-wsoc-tv.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Tripadvisor names uptown luxury hotel The Iveys among best in US WSOC TV</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ned-fulmer-spotted-with-wife-ariel-at-eras-tour-after-affair.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ned Fulmer Spotted With Wife Ariel at 'Eras Tour' After Affair</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
