Natalie Portman was appearing alongside Stephen Colbert for the first time, and both the guest and host were excited about the chat. Things got off to a promising start.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>However, it would appear as though things took a shift after Colbert mentions that named Jared Kushner. Colbert asks, "Can I ask you something about Kushner at Harvard? Do you have memories of him? Were you guys friends? Did you hang out?"</p><p>Credit to Colbert for asking permission to discuss Kushner. Portman had no problem whatsoever, and was completely honest with her assessment.</p><p>Portman says, "We were friendly." Portman then stumbles when she's asked if he was a good student, to which she clearly says he wasn't. When Colbert asks to elaborate, Portman answers, "What can I say on TV? Um. There's not a lot to say that's funny about someone who became a super villain. It's not funny. He said in some interview about the friends he's lost, it's like exfoliating. I was like, okay, I like the spa metafors."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>"You're a dead skin cell," Colbert replies. "Proudly," Portman says which receives a big applause from the audience. The moment is definitely worth taking a look back on.</p><a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/your-paragraph-text-2024-02-20t124714-802.png> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Stephen Colbert's Audience Gasped After Emily Blunt Gave Them A Closer Look At Her Wardrobe</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Emily Blunt surprised fans after she gave an extra peek at her stunning outfit on the Late Show with Stephen Colbert.</span><p>The interview had a near 4 million views, and fans were chiming in on YouTube sharing their opinions on Portman and Colbert's discussion.</p><h2 id=natalie-portman-was-praised-for-her-comments-about-jared-kushner-and-her-thoughts-on-being-vegan>Natalie Portman Was Praised For Her Comments About Jared Kushner, And Her Thoughts On Being Vegan</h2><p>Over 3K fans shared their thoughts on the interview.

Portman also discussed her journey as a vegan, which started at the age of 9.
