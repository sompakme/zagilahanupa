It sufficed in bringing Wanda's time in Westview to an end, but it disappointed audiences when none of the most plausible fan theories panned out. And on top of some obvious ones, like the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>MCU</strong></a>'s Stephen Strange (Benedict Cumberbatch) dropping in to speak with Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen) not happening, several other subplots went unresolved.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>While the Disney+ series deserves credit for delivering some excellent storytelling over the nine-episode season, there's something to be learned from its lackluster finale. The lesson is to wrap things up in a neat bow. Take Vision (Paul Bettany), for example.</p><p>The instant that Wanda's remnant version gave the copy his memories, he jettisoned off to who knows where. Jac Schaeffer pointed out to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CinemaBlend</a> that audiences didn't get to see, so that White Vision would have an open future in the MCU. One not tied down to any specific path. There's a logic in doing so within the grand scheme of things, but what irked some viewers was that the show's producers could've at least given Vision a few lines of dialogue to determine where he stands in the battle of good versus evil, yet they left his departure a mystery.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Vision subplot is just one of the crucial flaws with the finale. There were more, and while not positive, they offer Marvel Studios a bit more insight into what works in their streaming service branch of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and what doesn't.</p><h2 id=how-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-holds-up>How 'Falcon And The Winter Soldier' Holds Up</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/falcon-and-shield.jpg><p>These new insights pertain to Marvel Studios' near future because they have several series like WandaVision coming out soon. They're all guaranteed to build on the existing storylines, expanding on Phase 4 as they go, but what Marvel/Disney needs to consider is how to avoid the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">mistakes they made with the WandaVision Series Finale</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>As mentioned, Marvel can do so by simply wrapping up their smaller stories more efficiently. Like Falcon And The Winter Soldier. That show needs to end with either Bucky (Sebastian Stan) or <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sam Wilson (Anthony Mackie) officially becoming Captain America</a>. Everything is in motion for one of them to accept Steve Rogers' mantle, and if Marvel opts not to crown one of them the new Cap at the end of Falcon And Winter Soldier, you can safely assume there'll be equally harsh critiques.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Everything We Know About 'The Falcon And The Winter Soldier' Cast</a></span></p><p>There is, however, an argument to be made for why neither will become the next Captain America, and it is Season Two. Plans for a sophomore season aren't official yet, but Marvel <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">President Kevin Feige seems to think it's a distinct possibility</a>. In that case, perhaps delaying the rise of a new Cap could work. John Walker (Wyatt Russell) is also donning the star-spangled costume in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Falcon And Winter Soldier as U.S. Agent</a>, so the show might not wrap with either of the central heroes becoming the next Captain America. Of course, that still doesn't excuse Marvel if they leave us guessing who's the new Cap at the end of Season 1.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nevertheless, what the studio should take away from WandaVision's stitched-together conclusion is that they need to cut the vague cliffhangers to give fans some closure. Even if it's an inconvenience to bigger payoffs later down the line, audiences deserve more. They're sticking around week-in and week-out to see what happens. The least that Marvel can do to repay them for their diligence is deliver on a satisfying season finale. And that includes not leaving them pondering questions that could get resolved in a few minutes or less. But if the studio doesn't bother, fans can once again expect to voice disappointing reactions to shows like Falcon And The Winter Soldier's and its freshman season.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">What's Next For Paul Bettany's Vision</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrqivtWeo2abkaN6rbHAq6VmnqKkum7DwKebmq6ZqLawutJmpKKrpJa4pr%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./where-are-the-stars-of-glow-now.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Where Are The Stars Of GLOW Now?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rapper-eminem-signed-with-wwe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Rapper Eminem Signed With WWE?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
