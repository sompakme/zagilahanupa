Of course, in some ways being a celebrity parent makes things a lot easier since stars have the means to provide their kids with whatever they want. However, every parent has said or done something that they regret, and in those cases, they were lucky the world wasn’t paying attention. After all, celebrity parents are often judged for the choices they make.</p><p>Even though Bradley Cooper is a massive star, he has mostly pulled off something that a lot of celebrity parents are likely jealous of. After all, Cooper has mostly managed to keep his relationship with this daughter, Lea, out of the headlines. Fortunately for anyone who is curious about how Cooper conducts himself as a parent, it is possible to learn about the actor’s relationship with his daughter without invading his privacy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/untitled-design-6.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Every Bradley Cooper Movie That Has Grossed Over $100 Million At The Box Office</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bradley Cooper has made a significant impact on the film industry through his talent, dedication, and wide-ranging roles.</span><p><strong>Updated April 2024:</strong>Bradley Cooper said that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he did not know if he "would be alive"</a> if it were not for his daughter, Lea, when appearing on the "Armchair Expert" in February 2024. When host, Dax Shepard asked Cooper to expand what he meant by this, Cooper could only say that he was "not sure" but that the impact that his daughter has had on him has been profound. So much so that while Cooper has admitted that while it took him eight months to really "feel connected" to Lea, he made a concerted effort to have a better relationship with her than Cooper's father did with him.</p><h2 id=bradley-cooper-the-father>Bradley Cooper The Father</h2><h3 id=bradley-cooper-had-daughter-lea-with-ex-irina-shayk-in-2017>Bradley Cooper had daughter, Lea, with ex, Irina Shayk in 2017</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar53503466-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After previously marrying and divorcing the actor Jennifer Esposito, Bradley Cooper would go on to be romantically linked to the Russian supermodel Irina Shayk. <strong>Together from 2015 until 2019</strong>, even though Cooper and Shayk weren’t able to stay together long-term, they still appear to have a positive relationship. That is a wonderful thing as Cooper and Shayk had a daughter named Lea in early 2017.</p><p>In the years since Bradley Cooper’s daughter was born, the popular actor has largely avoided talking about his personal life. However, during a 2018 NPR interview, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cooper talked about being a father</a>. After joking about being “opened up to a world of children’s music”, Cooper addressed how being a dad has changed the way he looks at things.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/bradley-cooper-s-prosthetic-in-maestro-isn-t-sitting-well-with-fans-and-hollywood.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Bradley Cooper's Post-Maestro Interview Made Fans Cringe (Even If His Performance Was Oscar-Worthy)</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Bradley Cooper may be a bit too obsessed with Leonard Bernstein for his fans' liking.</span><p>“So I guess having a child, and having a family of my own — which is a miracle and something I’ve always dreamt of — has opened me up even more, I guess, to the day, and to be present.” Of course, if you asked most active parents, they would admit that having a child makes you more vulnerable. That said, the important thing is how good you are as a parent.</p><h2 id=how-fatherhood-changed-bradley-cooper>How Fatherhood Changed Bradley Cooper</h2><h3 id=bradley-cooper-39-s-view-of-the-world-completely-changed-after-becoming-a-father>Bradley Cooper's view of the world completely changed after becoming a father</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/instar53299956-1.jpg><p>In 2019, Bradley Cooper again discussed being a father this time on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Directly asked how being a dad has changed him, Cooper’s response was unsurprisingly wide-ranging.</p><p>“I think like [in] every way. I mean, it allowed me to embrace my childlike self without any sort of like, fear of judgment," Cooper explained. "Like, I could just play with toys all day long and not feel like- is this weird? Or watch cartoons endlessly and not think I'm wasting my life. I love cartoons."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After that interview, Cooper took part in The Ellen DeGeneres Show’s Burning Questions game. During that segment, Cooper was asked how he makes his daughter Lea laugh and Bradley responded that he would “dance goofily” which is easy to imagine.</p><h2 id=what-irina-shayk-thinks-of-bradley-cooper-39-s-fathering-skills>What Irina Shayk Thinks Of Bradley Cooper's Fathering Skills</h2><h3 id=irina-shayk-has-only-praised-bradley-cooper-39-s-skills-as-a-father>Irina Shayk has only praised Bradley Cooper's skills as a father</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/39-1.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Unfortunately, it can be extremely difficult for people to gauge for themselves how successful they are as parents. After all, a lot of parents who care deeply about doing things right beat themselves up for any mistakes they feel like they make. For that reason, in a lot of cases, it is the people who are the closest to each parent that are in the best position to judge their performance.</p><p>Since Bradley Cooper became a dad, <a href=#>his ex-partner and the mother of his child</a>, Irina Shayk, has been pretty open about his performance as a father. For example, in 2021, Shayk talked about Cooper’s relationship with their daughter during a HIGHStyle magazine interview.</p><p>"He's a full-on, hands-on dad — no nanny," Shayk said. "Lea went on holiday with him for almost two weeks [and] I didn't call them once."</p><p>Of course, most parents don’t get praise for parenting without a nanny since that isn’t a realistic option for them. However, it makes sense that Shayk would bring that up since most people know that a lot of stars seemingly let nannies do a lot of work raising their kids.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Later in the aforementioned interview, Irina Shayk described how she and Bradley Cooper have chosen to raise their daughter.</p><p>"Me and her father are very strict. When she finishes eating, she gets up from the table, takes her plate, says 'thank you.' Without 'please' or 'thank you' she's not getting anything," Shayk explained. "It's hard, because she has so many toys. I had one doll, and I still have this doll. Blonde, blue eyes, big Russian doll. My grandma used to make clothes for her. I always explain, 'Look, this is my doll. I had only one.' Or sometimes, 'You have this candy. I used to have candy only for Christmas.'"</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiZq5mUobK6ecKopqmdomK%2FprjAraCopqOdtrF51qKroWWYnsBusMCunqGslad6rbHAZqurraSdfA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-vampire-diaries-cast-reunites-without-ian-somerhalder.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Vampire Diaries Cast Reunites Without Ian Somerhalder</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-matt-landry-murder-case-a-tragic-kidnapping-and-killing.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Matt Landry Murder Case: A Tragic Kidnapping and Killing</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
