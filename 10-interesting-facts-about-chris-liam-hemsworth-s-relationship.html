Sibling rivalry doesn’t necessarily exist between these two brothers since they always want what’s best for each other and are always willing to support each other in their personal lives and in their careers.</p><h2 id=chris-amp-liam-hemsworth-both-auditioned-for-the-role-of-thor><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Chris & Liam Hemsworth Both Auditioned For The Role Of Thor</span></h2><p>Chris Hemsworth is the brother who ended up landing the role of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Thor in the&nbsp;MCU</a> but once upon a time, Liam Hemsworth actually audition for the role as well. This just goes to show that sibling rivalry truly does not exist between these two brothers.</p><p>They were able to compete for the same part and still maintain the same strong relationship with one another despite the fact that one brother was chosen over the other. Liam Hemsworth was obviously very happy for his brother when Chris landed the role of Thor.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=chris-amp-liam-hemsworth-are-both-more-well-known-than-their-brother-luke><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Chris & Liam Hemsworth Are Both More Well Known Than Their Brother Luke</span></h2><p class=p1>Chris and Liam Hemsworth have another brother… <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Luke Hemsworth</a>.

A lot of people in the world see Chris Hemsworth as their hero since he takes on the heroic role of Thor in the MCU.
