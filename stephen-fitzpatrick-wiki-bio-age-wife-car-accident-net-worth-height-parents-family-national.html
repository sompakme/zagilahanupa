According to their record label, Heist or Hit, “the pair bonded over a love of peculiar, sardonic humour and wide eyed observations. Dream-pop outfit Her’s is the natural extension to the solitary decoding of the cultures they grew up in.”</p><p>Their band had been building a following and getting airplay on BBC Radio. Their 19-date tour of the U.S. was their second tour of the country and followed the release of their 2018 album “Invitation to Her’s.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=hers-band-members></span> Her’s Band Members<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The Liverpool-based band Her’s consisted of two members, Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading.&nbsp;Stephen Fitzpatrick performed vocals and played guitar while Audun Laading played bass and sang backing vocals.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=stephen-fitzpatrick-hers-age></span> Stephen Fitzpatrick Hers Age<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was 24 years old at the time of his death.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=stephen-fitzpatrick-nationality></span> Stephen Fitzpatrick Nationality<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>He was of British nationality.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=band-hers-car-accident></span> Band Hers Car Accident<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Both Her’s band members Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading, and their tour manager Trevor Engelbrektson, died while travelling to a show in Santa Ana, California on Wednesday, 27th March 2019.</p><p>Celebrity Deaths 2019</p><p>The band’s record label, Heist or Hit, confirmed the news in a statement. Heist or Hit said: “It is with overwhelming sadness that we regretfully inform you that Liverpool band Her’s, Stephen Fitzpatrick and Audun Laading and their tour manager Trevor Engelbrektson tragically passed away in a road accident in the early hours of Wednesday, 27th March whilst travelling to a show in Santa Ana, California. We are all heartbroken.</p><p>“Having recently released their debut album “Invitation to Her’s”, Stephen and Audun were on their second tour of North America playing 19 dates of sold-out shows to a fanbase that adored them. The pair were one of the UK’s most loved up and coming bands.</p><p>“Their energy, vibrancy and talent came to define our label. As humans, they were warm, gentle and hilarious. Each time they stopped by the office made for an uplifting experience. To say they were close would be an underestimation of a friendship that was genuinely beautiful to witness; they loved one another like brothers. Musically, Her’s were astonishing. An aptitude for melody, fun, and entertainment combined with a complexity that was as sophisticated as it was stylish. They were in America playing to thousands of adoring fans. Fans they made a point of meeting and spending time with, such was their passion and humbleness. The world was at their feet. Everyone here at the label is overwhelmed and distraught. We have lost our friends and the world has been denied their talent. – Heist or Hit (Mick Scholefield, Martin Colclough & Patrick Fogarty).</p><p>“Our thoughts and prayers are with the families of Stephen, Audun and Trevor, please respect their privacy at this extremely difficult time.”</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=audun-laading-instagram></span> Audun Laading Instagram<br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/BqaMDa6gppw/</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKukmr2psc1mnaKsqqWutb7InKJmr5mgtm6uyKhkmp%2BVYsSqssRmmpqqXZawpLXDnqWtZZ6awW7DzquroWWYmraotNNmp5qqlaPBtHnFmqSipKliu6LAyKilmqSZqcZutMSrqmaakaOxbrnEppmeqqNivam706iqZpmemXqqutKtmKCqkaJ8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-heartbreaking-truth-about-adele-s-weight-loss.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Heartbreaking Truth About Adele's Weight Loss</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./new-england-patriots-and-robert-kraft-15-secrets-about-him-and-the-team.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>New England Patriots And Robert Kraft: 15 Secrets About Him And The Team</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
