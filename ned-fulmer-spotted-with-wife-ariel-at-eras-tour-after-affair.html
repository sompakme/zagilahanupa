The only thing that matters right now is my marriage and my children, and that’s where I am going to focus my attention.”</p><p>Ariel, for her part, thanked fans who had “reached out” amid the drama. “Nothing is more important to me and Ned than our family, and all we request right now is that you respect our privacy for the sake of our kids,” she wrote in a since-deleted Instagram post.</p><p>As the scandal unfolded, eagle-eyed social media users noticed that Ariel <a href=#>removed the word “wife”</a> from her Instagram bio, which currently reads, “Interior Designer • Stylist • Podcast Host • Cookbook Author • Boy Mama.” (Ariel and Ned share sons Wesley, 5, and Finn, 2.)</p><p>Ned’s bio, however, seemingly remained unchanged. As of Monday, August 7, it reads: “Comedian and #1 NYT Bestseller (aka @arielmfulmer’s Husband).”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Despite his infidelity, Ned and Ariel never officially announced plans to separate.</p><p>The couple were among many notable attendees at the Eras Tour this weekend as Swift played the first of six L.A. shows. <a href=#><strong>Channing Tatum</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Max Greenfield</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ashley Tisdale</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Sofia Richie</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Jesse Tyler Ferguson</strong></a> and more stars turned out for the can’t-miss concert.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGannZRis7a4zJ6pZqugpMG1scNmrqKsmGLEqrLEZpiroZWheqLAjJ6pmqtdqby2voyana2domKup7LAoqlo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./taylor-swift-denies-relationship-problems-by-wearing-travis-bracelet-as-he-skips-her-birthday.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Taylor Swift Denies Relationship Problems By Wearing Travis Bracelet As He Skips Her Birthday</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./kaitlynn-carter-news-us-weekly.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Kaitlynn Carter News - Us Weekly</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
