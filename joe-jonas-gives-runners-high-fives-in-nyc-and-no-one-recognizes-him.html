In the clip, he reached his arm out while offering high fives. Although some runners gave him one back, others ran past Jonas and ignored his<a href=#> attempt at comradery</a>. One thing all the runners had in common is none of them appeared to recognize the singer.</p><p>“Hyping up strangers with high-fives during their 6pm run 🙏🏃,” he captioned the post as <strong>Natasha Bedingfield</strong>’s “Pocketful of Sunshine” played in the background. “Don’t leave me hanging 🥲😂.” Fans laughed with Jonas in his comments section.</p><p>“I literally ran right past him in Brooklyn and was wondering why I was being recorded & he was trying to high five me! Didn’t realize who he was!!” one follower who ran by Jonas commented. “Imagine dodging a stranger’s high five only to get home, scroll tiktok, and find out it was Joe 💀,” another wrote, as a third social media user quipped, “When they realize the weird guy high giving everyone is JOE JONAS.”</p><p>Jonas was back in NYC before he takes off on is the 2024 leg of <a href=#>The Tour </a>with brothers <strong>Nick Jonas</strong> and <strong>Kevin Jonas</strong>. Starting in Manila, Philippines, the Jonas Brothers are traveling through countries including France, Australia, England, Mexico, Argentina and more.</p><a title=@joejonas href=#>@joejonas</a><p>Don’t leave me hanging 🥲😂</p><p><a title="♬ Pocketful of Sunshine - Natasha Bedingfield" href=#>♬ Pocketful of Sunshine – Natasha Bedingfield</a></p><p>During their shows, the Jonas Brothers sing 67 hits from albums including The Album, which dropped in 2023, Happiness Begins (2019), Lines, Vines and Trying Times (2009), A Little Bit Longer (2008), and Jonas Brothers (2007).</p><p>In December 2023, the band announced they’ll be hosting a <a href=#>20th anniversary concert</a> in 2025, after The Tour concludes.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“[From] two nights at Yankee Stadium, we have since played 61-or-something shows. We’ve reached the end, but we left you all a card on your seats, I don’t know if you got those when you got in,” Nick, 31, told the crowd while playing at New York’s Barclays Center in Brooklyn.</p><p>Joe then replied, asking what the note said while Nick explained, “OK, so in 2025, it’ll be the 20-year anniversary of this ban. And that card was your formal invite [because] we’re gonna do this thing again.”</p><p>The Jonas Brothers recorded their first song, “Please Be Mine,” in 2005. They later starred in Disney’s 2008 Camp Rock, before creating their own series, Jonas, from 2009 until 2010.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajp5Vit7C6wKxkoKGmmsBuvtSnpZ6qo2K1qrPHZp2irpWoeqq6jKewnGWRo7Fuus5mpqedXaeypLvGp6CznaNitaq5jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-netflix-s-emmy-winning-show-the-crown-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Netflix's Emmy-Winning Show 'The Crown' Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./harry-potter-cast-current-ages-relationship-statuses-and-net-worths.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Harry Potter Cast: Current Ages, Relationship Statuses, And Net Worths</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
