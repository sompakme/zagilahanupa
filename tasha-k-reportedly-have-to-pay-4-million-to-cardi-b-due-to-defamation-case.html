Ray II has granted Cardi B’s motion requesting a Supersedeas Bond, which requires the internet personality to provide collateral to cover a payment of $3,863,753.47 through a bond company, per <a href=#><i>AllHipHop</i></a><i>.</i></p><p>The decision comes after Tasha (real name Latasha Kebe) requested the courts stop the “Up” rapper’s attempt to garnish her wages.</p><p>“When and if the Defendants post a bond in the amount of $3,863,753.47 which guarantees unconditionally to pay said amount in satisfaction of the Judgment awarded by the Court to the Plaintiff,” Ray wrote in court documents, “then and in that event the Court also GRANTS the Defendants’ Motion to Stay. Otherwise, the Defendants’ Motion to Stay is DENIED.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single><b>RELATED: </b><a href=#><b>Cardi B Visits Her Former Middle School In Bronx And Give A $100,000 Donation</b></a></span></p><p>Gossip vlogger Tasha K says she hasn’t moved to Africa, despite rumors that she decamped to the continent to avoid paying a $4 million defamation judgment to Cardi B</p><p>“I promise you there is nothing to report on … I’m enjoying my trip abroad,” she told The Daily Beast via Twitter on Thursday, adding an emoji of clinking champagne glasses.</p><p>The YouTuber, whose real name is Latasha Kebe, has toyed around with the reports nonetheless.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“Life in Africa is turning out to be exactly what I needed. A fresh start !” she wrote in an Instagram caption earlier this week alongside a photo of her wearing a hijab. The post has the location tagged as Morocco, and includes a promise from Tasha to release a vlog documenting her life in Africa. Then, on Wednesday, she engaged in a public spat with Cardi on Twitter, with the rapper telling her to “SEND MY CHECK.” Tasha turned up the heat in another Instagram post: “Since your fav keeps BEGGING for these little coins, ask her how she wants the 4 million? In Guinea Francs or Ugandan Shillings ?”</p><p>Hip-hop gossip sites and social media accounts subsequently began speculating that Tasha had left the country to evade the law, but it’s all looking like more bluster from the controversial Atlanta-based commentator, according to the <a href=#><i>Daily Beast.</i></a></p><p>The bond allows Tasha K to move forward with any attempts she might make to appeal the judgement granted in Cardi B’s favor in January. However, it also serves to make sure that, should her appeals be denied, the court will be able to pay the close to $4 million award immediately.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Tasha made a request to have the bond thrown out altogether, thus effectively giving her more time to make the full payment — a request which Ray struck down.</p><p>“The Court grants the Defendants the right to supplement their pleadings with authority as to why they are entitled to a hearing, and in any event to provide through their pleadings evidence which would justify a bond in an amount less than the full amount of the Judgment,” Ray said. “If such evidence is provided through supplementation of the pleadings, then the Court would re-examine whether the amount of the bond as set herein should be modified.”</p><p>In January, Cardi B was initially awarded $1.25 million in damages after seeking $75,000 in a defamation lawsuit in 2019. Her beef with Tasha K stems from the “Press” rapper claiming the vlogger made a video on her popular unWinewithTashaK YouTube channel that said the rapper was a prostitute and had herpes.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In January, U.S. District Judge William M. Ray ruled in Cardi B’s favor, ordering Tasha to pay the rapper $2.5 million in damages and $1.3 million in legal fees. In May, Ray further banned Tasha from alleging that Cardi “sold pussy” or that she’s a “cokehead” in any of her videos. He also banned Tasha from claiming that Cardi had “beer bottles up her vagina,” according to a permanent injunction that directed the vlogger to delete about 20 videos from her YouTube account.</p><p>But the legal fallout hasn’t stopped Tasha from continuing to go after the Grammy-winning rapper. She’s since filed an appeal to the verdict, after her first one was withdrawn due to procedural errors. In the appeal, her attorneys argued that the trial was “lopsided” and didn’t allow them to present evidence of Cardi’s “character.”</p><p>Cardi B’s attorney declined to comment pending the results of the appeal.</p><p><span class=next-single><b>READ NEXT: </b><a href=#><b>Trinidad James Revealed Gold All In His Nails For $2,500</b></a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sources: <a href=#>AllHipHop</a>, <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>, <a href=#>HiphopDX</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGTBor%2FHmmSkZaKavbC%2B056bpbFdna63sYytpmaoka56dXnMoqOloZ%2BjerW7jJyYq5yZYq9usNSeZK2nXZmyp63Mmquip55isKK%2FxGg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-cast-of-ginny-and-georgia-ranked-by-net-worth.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The Cast Of Ginny And Georgia, Ranked By Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./rhony-alum-jill-zarin-is-dating-gary-brody.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>RHONY Alum Jill Zarin Is Dating Gary Brody</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
