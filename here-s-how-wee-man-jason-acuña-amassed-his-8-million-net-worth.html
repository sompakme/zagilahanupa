The long-running TV personality is known for his diminutive size, of course, but there's far more to Jason than his achondroplasia.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>For one thing, there's his sense of humor. But it turns out that Wee Man has a few other things going for him. While fans weren't impressed with <a href=#>Bam Margera suing the show over his firing</a>, most people have nothing but love for Jason Acu単a.</p><p>Although, some are wondering where he's been all these years, especially since the earlier iteration of the uncomfortably real reality show ended.</p><p>As it turns out, Wee Man has built an impressive net worth and has kept plenty busy in some unique ways since semi-retiring from 'Jackass.'</p><h2 id=what-is-wee-man-39-s-net-worth>What Is Wee Man's Net Worth?</h2><p>It seems as if various sources can't quite agree on Wee Man's net worth. Most suggest he's worth about $8M, but some estimates range up to as much as $12 million.</p><p>Either way, Acu単a has built up an impressive fortune, especially given his lack of blockbuster films. And despite his lack of mainstream success, plenty of people recognize Jason out in public and ask him for photos.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>What more could a reality TV star want?</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Here's What The Cast Of MTV's 'Jackass' Is Up To Now</a></span></p><p>Because while he's no doubt a serious actor, Wee Man has often chosen roles that are comedic and, oftentimes, dangerous. After all, he spent not just 16 episodes on the original 'Jackass,' but he went on to appear in various film specials, too.</p><p>But what has he been doing since the original iteration of 'Jackass' (with all its risky stunts) ended?</p><h2 id=what-is-wee-man-doing-now>What Is Wee Man Doing Now?</h2><p>Jason Acu単a stuck around TV for a while after the original 'Jackass' stopped airing, with brief stints on shows like 'Punk'd,' 'MADtv,' 'Wildboyz,' and even 'Celebrity Circus.' There were some 'Jackassery' reiterations, too, but Wee Man took on a different role this time around.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Sure, he still appeared on screen (and he will again in 2021's upcoming 'Jackass Forever'), but Wee Man also has credits as a writer for the film. He also had credits for previous movies, which no doubt helped him build up his millions.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything We Know About Bam Margera's Current Relationship With Johnny Knoxville And 'Jackass'</a></span></p><p>That's not the only way he's earned a living, though. Wee Man also invested in the restaurant chain Chronic Tacos. But what Chronic Tacos does Wee Man own now?</p><p>While one of his restaurants in Redondo Beach wasn't a great success, he later opened a spot in Long Beach that has remained successful. And Jason has other business endeavors that are keeping him busy (and well-paid).</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>One of his recent collabs has been with Merge4, the products for which Jason regularly reps on his social media. The brand sells socks, among other products, and Wee Man is even doing meet-and-greet events on behalf of Merge4.</p><p>There's still more to Acu単a's story beyond his film roles and business plans, though.</p><h2 id=is-wee-man-married>Is Wee Man Married?</h2><p>Though it's tough to confirm Jason's dating history, it seems that he's not married. At least, not yet. He has shared snapshots of himself with a woman, but it's tough to pin down details.</p><p>What's clear, however, is that Jason doesn't have children. His friendships are always shared on his social media, but he's a bit more tight-lipped about other aspects of his personal life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Real Reason Why Steve-O Made 'Jackass: The Movie'</a></span></p><p>The 48-year-old stuntman still has time to build a family, if that's what he wants. But he seems plenty busy with his work and, of course, skateboarding to this day. And while the most recent 'Jackass' film is set to come out this year, there's no telling what Jason will do next.</p><p>He's unlikely to duck out of Hollywood at this point, and he's definitely carved out a unique niche for himself.</p><h2 id=who-is-the-richest-39-jackass-39-cast-member>Who Is The Richest 'Jackass' Cast Member?</h2><p>While Wee Man has clearly made a decent living, he's not the richest 'Jackass' cast member -- not by a long shot. That title goes to <a href=#>Johnny Knoxville, who's worth a crazy $75 million</a>. The two appear to still be on good terms, too, though other former castmates aren't as buddy-buddy.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nor has every cast member maintained their net worth. Bam Margera, for his part, <a href=#>used to be worth about $45 million</a>, but he's since lost some of it over the years.</p><p>But there's no telling what may happen in the future. After all, with Jason's investments in restaurants, plus his other business endeavors, he could very well surpass Margera's net worth, at least.</p><p>And fans would definitely be rooting for him... and his delicious tacos and comfy socks.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Who Was The Highest Paid 'Jackass' Cast Member?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiunp1doq6vecmaqqimXZawtrrAZm9mpZmhuaq7zWalnqxdrLyzwMdo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hugh-hefner-i-pushed-lindsay-lohan-to-go-fully-naked-for-playboy.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>束&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hugh Hefner: I Pushed Lindsay Lohan to Go Fully Naked for Playboy</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./drake-serena-williams-caught-kissing-after-her-wta-victory.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;損</span><p class=pager__title>Drake, Serena Williams Caught Kissing After Her WTA Victory</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
