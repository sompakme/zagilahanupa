The actress received the prestigious honor for her role in the <strong>Alexander Payne</strong>-directed film Nebraska.</p><p>The movie, which also earned a Best Picture nomination, tells the story of an aging, booze-loving father (<strong>Bruce Dern</strong>, a Best Actor nominee) who takes a trip from Montana to Nebraska with his estranged son (<strong>Will Forte</strong>) in order to claim a dubious million-dollar Mega Sweepstakes Marketing prize. Squibb plays Kate Grant, the acerbic wife of Woody and mother of son David.</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Oscars 2014 red carpet dress predictions</a></p><p>So far, Squibb has lost out in the Best Supporting Actress category to American Hustle's <strong><a href=#>Jennifer Lawrence</a> </strong>at the Golden Globes, and 12 Years a Slave star <a href=#><strong>Lupita Nyong'o</strong></a> at the Critics' Choice Movie Awards — but that could all change at the Oscars on Sunday, March 2.</p><p>Here are five things to know about the Oscar nominee:</p><p><strong>1.</strong> She's not from Nebraska. Squibb was born and raised Vandalia, Ill. by parents JoyBelle and Lewis Squibb. JoyBelle was a well-known piano player, who played for silent movies in the 1920s, while Lewis worked in insurance. Squibb has one child, filmmaker <strong>Harry Kakatsakis</strong>, with late husband Charles Kakatsakis.</p><p>PHOTOS: What's your red carpet style personality?</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Squibb's been in the business for over 50 years! She started her career in musical theater, and made her Broadway debut in Gypsy as stripper Electra in 1960. Since then, she's appeared in numerous TV shows such as Ghost Whisperer in 2005, and played the wife of <strong>Jack Nicholson</strong>'s character in 2002's About Schmidt, which was also directed by Payne.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>3. </strong>She's 84 years old — and not ashamed to use it to her advantage! "Who knows how many more movies I have left in me? But don't worry about me! Honey, I'll be fine," Squibb joked on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, coughing. "So what if this is my last shot at happiness? I'll be just fine . . . Probably," she added, pretending to cry.</p><p><strong>4.</strong> She's pals with fellow Oscar nominee (and frontrunner) Nyong'o. After bumping into the 12 Years a Slave actress at a party in January, Squibb decided to introduce herself. "'I'm June Squibb. And we're in this together. And I feel like I should introduce myself,'" she recalled to <a href=#>USA Today</a>. "She really appreciated that. And we're friends. Every time we see each other, and that's a lot, there's a hug and a little bit of chat."</p><p><strong>5. </strong>Spoiler Alert! She plays <strong>Lena Dunham</strong>'s grandma on an upcoming season three episode of Girls. Squibb let it slip to <a href=#>Vulture</a> back in October that she'll appear on the show as Hannah Horvath's "dying" grandmother. Though her character doesn't make a long appearance, Squibb said of the role: "All the young people where I live are thrilled that I'm on that show. Doesn't matter what else I did, that show is very, very important."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajrZ6aerS91KKZm2VlYsGptc2gqmaxn6p6pbvNrWSkpp%2BseqKuzq6rZqyYmnqvscGrmKyjkWK8tK%2FAq2Snp52eu6axjGtnamxia39w</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./rich-franklin-net-worth-therichest.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Rich Franklin Net Worth | TheRichest</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./how-much-of-britney-spears-net-worth-is-spent-on-her-doberman-porsha-s-lavish-lifestyle.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Of Britney Spears' Net Worth Is Spent On Her Doberman Porsha's Lavish Lifestyle?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
