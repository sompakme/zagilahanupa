Raymond Ablack, for example, was a star of the <strong><a href=#>Netflix </a></strong>original show The Haunting of Hill House. Felix Mallard has also been in other Netflix productions, as he was a part of the hit television show Locke & Key. Fans always wonder how much celebrities make from working in television and film.

That was before she landed the role of Ginny in Netflix’s Ginny & Georgia.</p><p>In 2019, <a href=#>Gentry had a reported net worth of $100,000 to $300,000</a>.
