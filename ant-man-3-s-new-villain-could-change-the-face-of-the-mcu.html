Thanos had been chasing the infinity stones for the better part of a decade and was finally defeated for good by the Avengers. Yes, there were casualties, but for the most part, everything was wrapped up rather nicely.</p><p>Phase four was supposed to have started by now. However, the pandemic has led to its official start being delayed. <a href=#>Black Widow</a>, which has still not been released, was supposed to have hit theaters back in May. Right now, <a href=#>Marvel</a> fans were supposed to have been preparing for the release of The Eternals. Instead, we will have no idea how phase four will unfold.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>Olivia Wilde To Direct Untitled Female-Led Marvel Movie</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>A report claiming Marvel has cast someone to play a pretty major villain in Ant-Man 3 may have given us an idea of what's to come, though. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Deadline</a>, Jonathan Majors has been cast to play Kang the Conqueror in Ant-Man's third chapter. For those unfamiliar with Kang, he is a pretty big deal. The supervillain is an avid time traveler, which means the quantum realm will likely play a part in the movie.</p><p>via The Direct</p><p>In the comic books, Kang lives for so long and travels to so many different times that there are actually various different versions of him. He could appear as Immortus in some way, perhaps in another movie, or maybe even as Iron Lad, a much younger good-guy version of Kang. Plenty of options for Marvel, which is likely why Kang has been selected for this role.</p><p>One thing is for certain, Marvel needs to find a villain worthy of filling the void left by Thanos. The Mad Titan will go down as one of the most despicable bad guys in cinematic history. Kang might be the perfect replacement for Thanos, and with his ability to travel through time, he could prove to be even harder to stop for the Avengers than a foe who wiped out half the universe at one point.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>Rumor: Joker To Get Two Sequels Over The Next Four Years</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmpqemnrK0e8qapaBlk6S7ssHEq6arZZGjwW65wKdkbGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./celebs-wearing-sexy-one-piece-swimsuits-in-2022-pics.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Celebs Wearing Sexy One-Piece Swimsuits in 2022: Pics</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-perfect-match-trailer-drops-premiere-date-cast-more.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'The Perfect Match' Trailer Drops: Premiere Date, Cast, More</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
