Prior to starring in the Parenthood,&nbsp;Xolo was working on commercials and print ads. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">His first acting gig was a Sears commercial</a>&nbsp;which he landed at nine years old. It's quite evident that Mr. Maridueña was meant to be a star.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He has been acting professionally since he was 10 years old and despite initially viewing the craft as a side gig that could potentially pay for college, landing a role on&nbsp;Parenthood&nbsp;showed him that acting could be much more than a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">side hustle</a>. The Thespian decided to pursue his dream to become an actor, although he had actually wanted to be a chemist — at least until he took AP chemistry that is.

The Karate Kid franchise show has taken the world by storm and&nbsp;Maridueña is at the center of it all. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Having started his career acting in commercials</a>, the actor landed his first job at nine years old. The Sears commercial was his first audition and he nailed it.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He went on to appear in several commercials and print ads before landing his breakout role in Parenthood. Xolo worked alongside seasoned industry greats and describes the experience as a great first start for him as an actor. What better way to enter the Hollywood scene than on Parenthood?&nbsp;</p><p>It was while on the show that he realized that acting was a profession and that it was something he could do for a living.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cryptic Rock</a>, the star revealed, "It was a very interesting experience, especially being 11-12 years old in a world where everyone is basically over 30. Everyone is so experienced, especially on a show like Parenthood. Being thrown into the mix with all of these A-list actors/actresses was a little intimidating at first, but it was really a great first start for me as an actor. It really solidified for me, in my brain, that this is a profession, and this is something you can do for a living."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cobra Kai: Behind The Scenes Details & Secrets</a></span></p><h2 id=before-fame-came-knocking-he-wanted-to-be-a-chemist>Before Fame came Knocking He Wanted To Be A Chemist</h2><p>Xolo was born to act, he is a natural onscreen. His smooth transition into adulthood and more complex roles prove that the star is one to watch out for. Perhaps what might surprise most people is that acting was not his first option. The actor had initially wanted to be a chemist. Thanks to AP chemistry, he realized that it wasn't what he wanted to do for the rest of his life. Although he also revealed that if acting wasn't on the table, he'd have pursued a career is STEM.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Looper</a>, Xolo revealed, "Man, for the longest time I wanted to be a chemist. I think it wasn't until I took AP chemistry that I was like "I cannot do this, this is not what I want the rest of my life to be." Even throughout high school, I took all of my AP classes and did my fair share of those, but I think if acting wasn't around, I definitely would have done something in the STEM field. Maybe some sort of engineer or whatnot."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 Celebs Who Went To Ivy League Schools (& What They Majored In)</a></span></p><p>He loves acting, and was determined to put in the work. We bet his fans are glad Xolo pursued his dream to become an actor.</p><p>"I have buddies who are going through college and going through the process of becoming engineers right now and it's admirable. But I think it's the same kind of drive. I really love acting and I feel like because of that, I'm willing to put in the extra hours and really take the time for it. And they're the same with their craft, so I think there's a Cobra Kai for everyone."</p><p>Because he started out when he was pretty young, there were times when his job would clash with his education. Nevertheless, the star told Beyond The Spotlight, "I’m lucky enough to have teachers and counselors at my school that help me when I film. It is without a doubt a tough thing to manage AP Classes and being across the country filming. I’ve managed to make it work out and still pull above a 4.0 along the way."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Xolo is filled with exceptional talent and fervor and has what it takes to become one of Hollywood's most sought after leading men.
