The former <a href=#>The Bachelor </a>host confirmed the news on his Instagram account last Monday.</p><p>The television personality posted a series of images from their engagement, which took place at a winery in Napa Valley.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I love you @laurenzima. The next chapter starts now!” Harrison wrote in the caption.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Adele Is Releasing A New Album Inspired By Her Divorce</a></span></p><p>Plenty of familiar faces from the Bachelor franchise congratulated <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Harrison</a> and Zima in the comments, including Ben Higgins, Hannah Brown, Colton Underwood, Arie Luyendyk Jr., Sean Lowe, and Kaitlyn Bristowe, who currently co-hosts the long-running franchise with Tayshia Adams.</p><p>Zima also shared two of the images to her own Instagram account. “I didn’t know love could be like this,” she wrote of Harrison in the caption. “You are the most incredible partner.”</p><p>Harrison reportedly spent a small fortune on Zima’s engagement ring, which was designed by McClave Jewelers.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Mike Fried, the CEO of The Diamond Pro, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly </a>the ring likely cost $100,000, though the price could be higher depending on the quality of the diamonds. He estimates the ring has three or four round diamonds, and that the band appears to be yellow or rose gold.</p><p>Harrison and Lauren have been dating for three years after meeting through their involvement with the Bachelor franchise. Lauren is currently a Bachelor Nation correspondent and entertainment reporter for Entertainment Tonight. Harrison was a recurring guest on her ET’s Bachelor segments, where they first connected.</p><p>Harrison hosted The Bachelor from its start in 2002 until 2021. He also hosted many other shows in the ABC franchise, including <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Bachelorette</a>, Bachelor Pad, and Bachelor in Paradise, until he stepped down from his position earlier this year.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In February, Harrison received backlash after defending former Bachelor contestant Rachel Kirkconnell’s racially insensitive behaviour. Days later, he announced he was taking a step away from the franchise before later revealing he was permanently leaving his position as host.</p><p>Harrison only spoke positively about The Bachelor franchise in a message shared to his Instagram confirming his exit. “I’m so grateful to the Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together,” he wrote. “The friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In June, we reported that Harrison had <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accepted a million-dollar settlement</a> from the network. In exchange, he reportedly agreed to remain silent about the franchise (and his termination) to the press.</p><p>There’s no word on when Harrison and Zima plan to tie the knot. This will be the second marriage for Harrison, who was previously wed to his former college girlfriend, Gwen Harrison, from 1993 to 2012, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE </a>reports. The exes share two children, Joshua and Taylor.</p><p>Sources: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PEOPLE Magazine</a>,</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEq6CcoJWowW%2BvzqZmq6GTnXqxu9aeqZ%2BtnGSwqb7IrGShmaKntrS7zWanq6egpMCmv4ytpmakkaq%2FprqMs6CmmV2strW0jJpkamhgZX1xedGipaBn</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dianna-fuemana-jay-ryan-s-girlfriend-biography-age-wiki-height-weight-boyfriend-family-m.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dianna Fuemana (Jay Ryans Girlfriend) Biography, Age, Wiki, Height, Weight, Boyfriend, Family &amp;amp; M</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ali-wentworth-why-parents-should-watch-porn-with-their-kids.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Ali Wentworth: Why Parents Should Watch Porn With Their Kids</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
