All actors and actresses have to get their start somewhere, and for many, they turned to the <strong>Disney Channel</strong> for work. As a result, there have been many celebrities who have had small guest-starring roles on our favorite Disney Channel shows.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Disney Channel Stars Who Are Married</a></span></p><p>From names we already know we’ll now like Tiffany Haddish, Evan Peters, and even Lucy Hale, you’d be surprised to find out that you might see them on some of your favorite Disney Channel shows like&nbsp;Hannah Montana, Wizards of Waverly Place,&nbsp;and&nbsp;That’s So Raven. Take a look back, you never know who you might see!</p><h2 id=victoria-justice><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>Victoria Justice</span></h2><p>Before she had her own show on Nickelodeon, <a href=#>Victoria Justice</a> guest-starred on&nbsp;The Suite Life of Zack & Cody. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Victoria played Rebecca</a>, a girl that was staying at the hotel because she was competing in a beauty pageant. The twins go into some hijinks and Cody&nbsp;wound up dressing up as a girl to compete in the same pageant. Even though Victoria played a rather small role, it was still an important one, as at the end of the episode Rebecca gave Cody his very first kiss.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=cyndi-lauper><span class=item-num>9 </span><span>Cyndi Lauper</span></h2><p>You might not have realized it when you watched it when you were younger, but Cyndi Lauper made a guest-star appearance on an episode of&nbsp;That's So Raven. Cyndi played an <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">art teacher named Ms. Petuto</a>. We all know how zany and out of this world Cyndi is in real life — she marches to the beat of her own drum. It only makes sense that she played an art teacher that's just as zany. She doesn't have a huge role, but for the time she's in the episode, she plays the role of a weird art teacher really well.</p><h2 id=alison-brie><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Alison Brie</span></h2><p>Before she was on the hit Netflix show&nbsp;Glow, <a href=#>Alison Brie</a> made her first acting debut on&nbsp;Hannah Montana.&nbsp;The role&nbsp;was her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first on-screen part</a>, and it was a silly one, that's for sure. She played the role of a hairdresser hired by Rico to mess with Jackson. She convinced Jackson to let her practice on him and gave him some insane haircuts. Of course, the role was silly, but it opened the door to her acting career, where she went on to get more well-known parts, but she can definitely thank&nbsp;Hannah Montana&nbsp;for her first big break.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=tiffany-haddish><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tiffany Haddish</span></h2><p><a href=#>Tiffany Haddish</a> might be a big celebrity these days, but it wasn't always that way. Like many other celebs, Tiffany had to work hard to get where she is today, and as a result, took on as many jobs and gigs that she could. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Back in 2005</a>, Tiffany appeared on&nbsp;an episode of That's So Raven. Tiffany didn't have a huge role, as she was only in the episode for a minute.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Actors We Completely Forgot Were On Disney Channel</a></span></p><p>She played a tour guide in a bio-dome that Raven and Chelsea take a trip to when one of Chelsea's old friends come to visit her. Of course, Raven always gets into her hijinks and gets into some trouble while at the bio-dome, and gets attacked by a giant plant. Tiffany warns the group that the plant is dangerous, and of course, Raven doesn't listen.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lucy-hale><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Lucy Hale</span></h2><p>Before <a href=#>Lucy Hale</a> became known for her role in&nbsp;Pretty Little Liars, she made a guest appearance on another popular show,&nbsp;Wizards of Waverly Place. Lucy played the role of Miranda Hampson, and she appears on the show for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">two episodes</a>. She's the new girl in town and she winds up dating Alex's brother, Justin. Their relationship doesn't last terribly long, as a jealous Harper messes with them and Justin winds up with a talking zit on his face that messes everything up between him and Miranda.</p><h2 id=joey-fatone><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Joey Fatone</span></h2><p>After NSYNC came to an end, the members of the ever so popular boy band had to find some other things to do. While some tried solo projects, <a href=#>Joey Fatone</a> decided that he wanted to try his hand at acting, and managed to score quite a few small roles here and there. One of those roles happened to be on the hit Disney Channel show&nbsp;Hannah Montana.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Disney Channel Kids Who Are Actually Doing Really Well Today</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joey played the role of Joey Vitolo</a>, who used to be a famous baseball player, but now owns an Italian restaurant. Miley accidentally destroyed Jackson's baseball signed by Joey and decided to use Hannah to get him to sign another one. Of course, it wasn't easy, as he made Hannah sing in the restaurant among other ridiculous tasks to get the ball signed.</p><h2 id=kat-graham><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Kat Graham</span></h2><p>Before she was a big name on the&nbsp;Vampire Diaries, <a href=#>Kat Graham</a> also had to work hard to get to where she is today. When she was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">just a teenager</a> at 19 years old, Kat played a small guest-starring role on&nbsp;Hannah Montana.&nbsp;She played the role of Allison, Jackson's on and off again girlfriend. She appeared in three episodes of the show during season 3, however, Allison and Jackson didn't make it very far and her time on the show came to an end. That's okay, though, because we know that her career only soared from there.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=austin-butler><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Austin Butler</span></h2><p>Like many of the actors and actresses on this list, <a href=#>Austin Butler</a> also got one of his first big breaks with a tiny guest-starring role on a Disney Channel show. Austin appears in&nbsp;Hannah Montant not once, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but twice</a>. The first time was such a tiny role that he was uncredited, however, the second time around he got a bigger role. He played the small role of Derek Hanson. Tired of playing the third wheel to Lily and her boyfriend, she gets set up on a blind date with Derek, and things don't go exactly as Miley planned them.</p><h2 id=zachary-quinto><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Zachary Quinto</span></h2><p>It's hard to believe that the man who plays Spock and has had a few roles on&nbsp;American Horror Story, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachary Quinto</a>, once had a guest-starring role on the favorite Disney Channel show,&nbsp;Lizzie McGuire. In the episode, Zachary played the role of an extremely snobby and pretentious director. Lizzie's dad and brother are chosen to be in a commercial for Cardio Punch Sports Drink. Things go south when Zachary's character makes things that much harder for them and the way they'd hope it would.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=evan-peters><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Evan Peters</span></h2><p>These days <a href=#>Evan Peters</a> is known for the insane characters that he plays on&nbsp;American Horror Story as well as his role in the&nbsp;X-Men&nbsp;franchise. Before that, though, he&nbsp;had to get his start somewhere. He had a short guest-starring stint on Disney's&nbsp;Phil of the Future. He played the role of Phil's super nerdy friend named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Seth Wosmer</a>. He appeared in several episodes to get into some shenanigans with Phil, as he was Phil's&nbsp;first friend. After the first season, Evan was no longer on the show.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT:&nbsp;<a href=#>10 Biggest Former Disney Channel Stars, Ranked By Instagram Followers</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwMieqmavmKR6qa3VnmSgrZWowW6%2F05qpq52UYryvecBmm6KrnprGbq%2FHmqWnnZxiwKm71mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
