The TV personality, who joined the cast of the Bravo hit in 2021 for season 11, thanked the fans for following along with her story.</p><p>Crystal teased, “This is not goodbye. It’s see you soon,” noting that her “biggest gift” has been “connecting” with the viewers.</p><p>“I’m so grateful for everyone’s love and support,” she added. “This has been such a fun chapter.”</p><p>Throughout her three seasons, Crystal has feuded with multiple costars from <a href=#><strong>Erika Jayne</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Annemarie Wiley</strong></a> to <a href=#><strong>Dorit Kemsley</strong></a>. She has also been vocal about her ups and downs with <a href=#>an eating disorder</a>, which began as a tween.</p><p>Outside of the show, Crystal reportedly made waves at 2023 BravoCon where she rubbed Southern Charm star <strong>Olivia Flowers</strong> <a href=#>the wrong way</a>.</p><p>After Olivia claimed via an Instagram comment in November 2023 that Crystal “was rude” at the fan event, Crystal fired back claiming she had “<a href=#>no idea who she is</a>.”</p><p>Crystal alleged during a December 2023 appearance on “The Viall Files” podcast that she’d never met Olivia, but there was a photo from a year prior when they did cross paths. Crystal explained that she thought Olivia was “mad” that she didn’t recognize her at BravoCon and therefore called her rude.</p><p>“[It’s] not rude. There’s a lot of people that don’t know who I am [and] I’m not like, ‘You’re rude. You should know who I am,’” Crystal said. “Genuinely, I don’t watch [any of the other Bravo] shows, so if I don’t recognize you, it’s not a [diss]. That’s an ego-driven thing that has nothing to do with me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Crystal-Minkoff-Exiting-The-Real-Housewives-of-Beverly-Hills-Ahead-of-Season-14-780.jpg><p>Prior to her exit from RHOBH, Crystal’s year was already off to a rocky start. The entrepreneur revealed in April that while she was overseas with her family, <a href=#>their house had been broken into</a>.</p><p>“I posted [I was out of town] and they tried to break in and my housesitters, my friends, had to deal with it face-to-face,” Crystal said during the April 12 episode of SiriusXM’s Jeff Lewis Live. “It was my girlfriend so she was very shaken up. She FaceTimed me and I think was very freaked out. I just felt so bad. It just reminded me that we need to step it up even more. Every time we hear a story, we step it up and [now] we’re going to go full on.”</p><p>Crystal, who was in Japan on spring break with her husband, <strong>Rob Minkoff</strong>, and their son Max, 11, and daughter Zoe, 8, confirmed that her friends were all OK after the scary incident.</p><p>Crystal isn’t the only possible casting shakeup RHOBH fans might see this year. Annamarie announced in March she’s <a href=#>not returning after one season</a>.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><strong>Kyle Richards</strong>, meanwhile, teased last month that her participation in season 14 <a href=#>will be a “last-minute” decision</a>.</p><p>“I think this season, particularly, because I had been so under the microscope, not just with the cast, but in the public eye,” Kyle, whose split from husband <strong>Mauricio Umansky</strong> was a main season 13 story line, told Extra in March. “It’s been very challenging to navigate through that when I’m just trying to figure out my life myself.”</p><p>The pair announced their separation in July 2023 but have not legally divorced.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJqrsaOprq15zKKlpKeWm3qmxMitqmasmJp6s7HApWShp6Wosri11Z6qZqeWYq%2BmwsSro7JlmJ65rb%2BO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./fans-are-convinced-amber-riley-is-harp-in-masked-singer-as-family-details-are-revealed.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Fans Are Convinced Amber Riley Is Harp In Masked Singer As Family Details Are Revealed</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./alessia-russo-partner-who-is-she-dating-2023.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Alessia Russo Partner: Who Is She Dating 2023?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
