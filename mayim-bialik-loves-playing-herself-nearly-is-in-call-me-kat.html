That’s the case for <a href=#><strong>Mayim Bialik</strong></a>, who is leading Fox’s Call Me Kat, a sitcom about a 39-year-old woman who chooses to quit her job and invest her savings in a cat cafe.</p><p>While Bialik, 45, is a cat-lover — and has three at home — that wasn’t actually the reason she was attracted to the project. <a href=#><strong>Jim Parsons</strong></a>, who played Bialik’s character’s husband on <a href=#>The Big Bang Theory,</a> brought her the script he was looking to produce, for a U.S. version of the hit British sitcom Miranda, and <a href=#>she couldn’t say no</a>.</p><p>“When Jim brought it to me, I thought he was just asking my opinion because we were friends and we have a lot of similar tastes,” she revealed during <a href=#>Us Weekly‘s “Watch With Us” podcast</a> on Tuesday, January 5. “I was like, ‘That sounds great. I totally think that’s a great idea!’ He was like, ‘No, Mayim. I’m telling you about this because I want you to play her.’ I was totally shocked that Jim Parsons wanted to still work with me. I think I’m very annoying, but he apparently thinks I’m not as annoying as I think I am, because he wanted to work with me!”</p><p>She added that “it was not easy” to get the show off the ground, and many people told them not to do it — then four networks all bid on the show based on the pitch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mayim-Bialik-Loves-Playing-A-Real-Woman-In-Call-Me-Kat.jpg><p>In addition to Parsons, 47, putting his trust in her, the Blossom alum also was drawn to the part because of the character.</p><p>“I love the opportunity to play a real woman. I love the opportunity to not be told, like, ‘Can you lose 20 pounds and just be like a better, skinnier version of yourself?’ I like just being myself,” she said. “I don’t wear Spanx. I’ve never had plastic surgery. I don’t dye my grays, like, this is a show about a woman who I hope other women and men will look at this and say like, ‘Oh, there’s women like that, and they <a href=#>can be funny, can be quirky</a>.’ Also, I get to play a woman who’s, like, occasionally vulgar and socially anxious and awkward, clumsy and fun. A multifaceted women.”</p><p>The neuroscientist added that even her mom asked why she’s not wearing more makeup on the show, but she explained that that’s not who Kat is.</p><p>“There were a lot of ridiculous conversations with executives, like, ‘Should she wear cardigans? Cardigans look a little old lady-ish,'” Bialik said. “I’m like, ‘I wear cardigans!’ [They said,] ‘No, they look too old lady-ish on TV.’ OK, so we will not wear a cardigan — conversations like that, but I think it matters.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Leslie-Jordan-Kyla-Pratt-Julian-Gant-Mayim-Bialik-Swoosie-Kurtz-and-Cheyenne-Jackson-Mayim-Bialik-Loves-Playing-A-Real-Woman-In-Call-Me-Kat.jpg><p>When taking on a new role, the Girling Up author noted that, of course, she feels pressure after so many successful roles — and is still living “in a perpetual state of shock and gratitude” every day.</p><p>“My grandparents were immigrants to this country. My family story is really like a lot of people’s — it’s a story of survival,” she told Us. “Everything is unbelievable to me that I get to experience. That being said, yeah, I was terrified to do anything after Big Bang Theory, and I still am. And the fact that I get to, like, hold Jim Parsons’ hand, I’ll be it through the internet, <a href=#>that’s my comfort zone</a>. I’m not a confident person. The fact that I could go into this with Jim and know that I had his company behind me and my company behind me, and that we had a friendship and a business partnership that was going to get through all the negotiations and all the things that you have to decide … it made it really appealing to me. I’m a creature of habit. And I had a job for nine years. That’s a long time in any field to have a job. So going out into the world is scary.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>For more from Bialik, listen to the full interview above and <a href=#>subscribe to our “Watch With Us” podcast</a> for more exclusive TV news and interviews.</p><p>Call Me Kat airs on Fox Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmqaeUmK60wNJorpqsk516uLXToWSuq1%2Birrq1zGaZopmcnrhuuM6vnKxloKGuurXNoGShnaKosq2yjKecmqqcrnqqv4yipWabkaG5brnEZqKarF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pinshilore-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pinshilore Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./louis-c-k-s-ups-and-downs-over-the-years.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Louis C.K.s Ups and Downs Over the Years</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-celebrities-who-have-guest-starred-on-a-disney-channel-show.html>10 Celebrities Who Have Guest Starred On A Disney Channel Show</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./jay-hartington-net-worth-2022-courtney-hansen-husband-and-their-beautiful-wedding-revisited.html>Jay Hartington Net Worth 2022, Courtney Hansen Husband and Their Beautiful Wedding Revisited</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./keeping-up-with-the-cash-the-kardashian-family-s-financial-empire-unraveled.html>Keeping Up With The Cash: The Kardashian Family's Financial Empire, Unraveled</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./the-traitors-mj-shares-wild-tweets-about-winners-ct-and-trishelle.html>The Traitors' MJ Shares Wild Tweets About Winners CT and Trishelle</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./who-is-anthony-templet-s-father-burt-templet-here-s-what-we-know-about-netflix-s-true-crime.html>Who Is Anthony Templets Father Burt Templet?
