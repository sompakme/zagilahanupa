Other of her theater roles include productions of Annie, Cinderella, and Big River.</p><p>After graduating from the Wesleyan University School of Theatre Arts, Moore decided to move to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career. She landed small roles on several television shows, including The Bad Girl’s Guide, Hyperion Bay, and Unhappily Ever After. She even landed a small guest appearance on Friends.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In 2002, Moore joined the cast of MADtv as a featured performance.

Ultimately, the actress couldn’t finish filming, so the producers decided to recast her roles and <a href=# rel=nofollow>her scenes had to be reshot</a> by Christina Moore due to the casting change.</p><p>Kelly turned to alcohol after dealing with the loss of her child. Her struggles with alcohol and substance abuse were what ultimately led to her leaving That 70s Show.
