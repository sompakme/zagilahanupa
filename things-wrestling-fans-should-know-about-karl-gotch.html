There, he’d start wrestling as Karl Gotch — a tribute to legendary World Champion Frank Gotch — and capture the World Heavyweight Championship for the Ohio-based American Wrestling Alliance.

There, he wrestled for legendary promotion Japan Wrestling Association as well as International Wrestling Enterprise, a promotion that lasted from 1966 to 1981. His time with IWE is of particular note, as Gotch had matches with fellow legends like Billy Robinson, and <a href=#>Andre the Giant</a>.

Together, the two would <a href=#>capture the World Tag Team Championship</a>, becoming the second-ever champions and holding the belts for a 57-day reign.</p><h2 id=special-workout><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Special Workout</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-training.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Karl Gotch’s studies also included Pehlwani, a martial art style from India. As part of this study, Gotch incorporated many exercises in his training, like Hindu squats and the bridge, which he taught to his students. As part of this training, Gotch developed a special workout, commonly referred to as <a href=#>the Gotch Bible</a>. The workout involves shuffling a deck of cards, and doing one of several exercises based on the card color and/or suit, with numerical value determining the number of repetitions.</p><h2 id=innovator-of-moves><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Innovator Of Moves</span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/karl-gotch-german-suplex.jpg><p>Karl Gotch’s “God of Wrestling” moniker doesn’t just extend to his technical skill and success and influence in Japan.
